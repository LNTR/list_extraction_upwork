agreements that contain an interest rate or other information in 
connection with the costs of credit to display the information in the 
form of a representat ive example, and having failed to provide training 
for staff providing services in connection with credit agreements for 
real estate.  It was also found that the bank  fails to provide for business 
records in connection with statements of early repayments o f credit that 
would allow the supervisory authority to verify the bank ’s compliance 
with the ZPotK -2.  
Operational part of order on rectification of breaches

area of consumer lending, Banka Slovenije finds the bank  to have breached:  
 
a) the third paragraph in connection with the second paragraph of Article 6 of the  ZPotK -2, by 
failing to display information in the form of a representative example when advertising in 
connection with a credit agreement that contains an interest rate or other information in 
connection with the costs of credit;  
 
b) the first paragraph of A rticle 61 of the ZPotK -2, by failing to provide regular training for all 
staff as defined in point 19 of Article 2 of the ZPotK -2, and the fourth paragraph of Article 61 
of the ZPotK -2, by failing to provide regular training for staff transacting with cons umers 
falling into difficulties in connection with arrears in the payment of past -due liabilities from 
credit agreements for real estate;  
 
c) Article 188 of the ZBan -3, by failing to organise its operations and to keep its books of 
account, business documenta tion and other administrative and/or business records current 
such that it is possible to verify at any time whether the bank is operating in accordance with 
the regulations referred to in the second paragraph of Article 9 of the aforementioned act in 
conn ection with Article 13 of the ZPotK -2, as it fails to store and fails to provide for the 
compilation or redisclosure of the statement of early repayment of credit that make evident the 
fee for the compilation of the statement in cases when a housing loan w as repaid by new credit

2021, a closing date of 10 June 2021; a contractual credit amount of EUR 105,000.00, an 
opening date of 22 December 2017, a closing date of 1 April 2021; a contractual credit

closing date of 28 May 2021) that it is requir ed to present to the consumer on paper or any 
other permanent data medium in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 22 of the 
ZPotK -2, and is therefore unable to submit statements of early repayments of credit to the 
supervisory authority for all c ases of early repayment for it to be subsequently verified

advertising, the bank  shall put in place a mechanism to monitor whether the aforementioned 
assumption is being upheld;  
 
b) provide for and regularly update training i) for all employees who perform tasks in connection 
with credit agreements for real estate, or who have contact with consumers within the 
framework of those tasks; ii) for the persons who directly manage and supervise the work of

Nature of identified 
breaches  Breaches in the area of credit risk management 
1. Deželna banka Slovenije d.d., of Kolodvorska ulica 9, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, registration 
number: 5349907 (hereinafter: the bank), has breached the first paragraph of Article 171 of the 
ZBan-3 by failing to put in place  and implement appropriate policies and procedures for managing 
credit risk because:  
- the risk management function organised within the Risk Management Department (RMD) 
fails to provide for adequate controls of the credit risk taking, because the opinions of the 
RMD do not include comprehensive and sufficient information, analysis and findings on the 
acceptability of credit proposals (including assessment of the borrower’s creditworthiness 
and risk profile) that in the process of approving credits form the basis for the decision of 
the bank’s highest decision-making body as required by the second paragraph of Article 4 of 
the Regulation on credit risk management at banks and savings banks (Official Gazette of 
the Republic of Slovenia, No. 115/21; hereinafter: Regulation on the credit risk 
management) and point (i) of paragraph 38 and paragraph 73 of the Guidelines on loan 
origination and monitoring (EBA/GL/2020/06 of 29 May 2020; hereinafter: Guidelines

needed for the creditworthiness assessment, and requirements for the creditworthiness 
assessment, including sensitivity analysis, as set out by the second paragraph of Article 5 of 
the Regulation on credit risk management in connection with points (b), (c) and (d) of 
paragraph 38 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06.  
The bank must ensure that the credit risk management policies and procedures put in place comply 
with the requirements of Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation on credit risk management and 
paragraphs 38 and 73 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06, and must implement them. 
 
To rectify the identified breaches, the bank must strengthen the role of the RMD in the credit 
process to put in place adequate controls of the credit risk taking, and to ensure that in the credit 
                                                      
1 Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06 are binding on banks and savings banks pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 2 of the 
Regulation on the application of the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (Official Gazette of the Republic of 
Slovenia, No. 104/20).  

Page 2 of 4 
 approval process the opinions of the RMD provide comprehensive and sufficient information 
(including assessment of the borrower’s creditworthiness and risk profile) that form the basis for 
deciding on a credit proposal at the level of the bank’s credit committee, and must define 
appropriate and accurate criteria for deciding on the approval of credits. . 
2. The bank has breached the first and second paragraphs of Article 172 of the ZBan-3 in connection 
with Section 5.2 and Annex 2 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06, by: 
- failing in the assessment of creditworthiness to apply appropriate and precisely defined criteria 
for deciding on the approval of credit, particularly in the corporate banking segment, in project 
financing and in certain retail subsegments; 
- failing in the credit approval process to adequately assess the borrower’s creditworthiness, 
because it has not got a methodology for assessment of creditworthiness n the aforementioned 
segments; 
- failing within the framework of credit documentation to provide for all the necessary 
information and analysis for deciding on a credit operation as required by Article 194 of 
Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06; 
- failing in the analysis of the financial position of corporates to apply realistic and reasonable 
financial projections as required by paragraphs 129 and 151 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06. 
The bank must ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 5.2 and Annex 2 of Guidelines 
EBA/GL/2020/06, and to rectify the identified breaches in decision-making on credit approval by 
applying clear and precisely defined requirements and criteria for credit assessment and approval, 
having regard for the specifics and risk level of individual products. The bank must formulate a 
methodology for the comprehensive assessment of creditworthiness of borrowers of the cited types, 
and must ensure that the borrower’s creditworthiness assessment is a key criterion in the approval of 
credit. For the creditworthiness assessment, the bank must put in place and implement appropriate 
procedures in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 129, 151 and 194 of Guidelines 
EBA/GL/2020/06. 
 
3. The bank has breached the third paragraph of Article 173 of the ZBan-3 in connection with Section 
7.2.1 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06 by failing to put in place appropriate policies and procedures 
for the monitoring and revaluation of immovable property collateral value. 
To rectify the identified breach, the bank must ensure compliance with paragraphs 221, 223, 224, 
225 and 226 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06, by putting in place and implementing appropriate 
policies and procedures for the revaluation and monitoring of the value of immovable property 
collateral. The policies and procedures for monitoring immovable property collateral value need to 
set out the approach with regard to elements such as the type of real estate, the credit quality of the 
loan secured by real estate, the development status of the real estate, the value of the real estate, 
assumptions made in the appraisal, and changes in market conditions. For the revaluation of 
immovable property collateral, it is necessary to set out when revaluation is undertaken by desktop 
valuation, when it is by drive-by valuation, when it is by full visit with internal and external 
assessment of the property, and when statistical models may be used. 
 
4. The bank has breached Article 107 in connection with Articles 124, 125, 126, 208 and 229(1) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on

No 648/2012 (OJ L 176 of 27 June 2013, p. 1; hereinafter: Regulation (EU) No 575/2013), by using, 
for the purposes of calculating capital requirements for credit risk, ineligible collateral that fails to 
meet the conditions prescribed by Articles 208 and 229(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and 
Section 7.2.1 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06.  
The bank must ensure that only collateral that meets the prescribed conditions of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013 and Section 7.2.1 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06 is used as eligible collateral for the 
purposes of calculating capital requirements. 
 
To rectify the identified breach, for the purposes of calculating capital requirements for credit risk 
the bank must exclude real estate whose value is not documented in accordance with Articles 208 
and 229(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 
 
For the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk as at 30 September 2022, the bank must

̶ the savings bank failed to provide in -house training in the wake of the introd uction of 
Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06 for all employees involved in the credit process.

monitored.  
 
3. The savings bank has breached the second paragraph in connection with the first paragraph of 
Article 172 of the ZBan -3, with the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Regulation on credit risk 
management,  and with paragraphs 122 and 145 of Guidelines EBA/GL /2020/06, by failing to apply

appetite, in that:  
̶ it uses revolving loans contrary to their nature and purpose;  
̶ it assesses the creditworthiness of natural persons contrary to the defined criteria;

borrower and the type, size and complexity of the credit facility, an d are not specified in 
relevant policies and procedures (identified with regard to customer ID 81456 in the reviewed 
sample of customers);  
b. in connection with Article 16 of the Regulation on credit risk management, in the credit 
origination and monitoring p rocess it improperly assigns credit ratings in the case of special 
types of financing, including the financing of newly established SPVs, and fails to take account 
of all significant and up -to-date information when classifying customers (identified with re gard 
to customer ID 80594 in the reviewed sample of customers);  
c. in connection with the first paragraph of Article 178 of the CRR, as a result of irregular 
monitoring it fails to identify cases where default has occurred and where the debtor is unlikely 

 
Page 3 of 5 
 to repay their credit obligations to the institution without recourse by the institution to actions 
such as realising security (identified with regard to customer ID 79123 in the reviewed sample 
of customers);  
d. in connection with the seventh indent of the four th paragraph of Article 12 and the first 
paragraph of Article 16 of the Regulation on credit risk management, and in connection with 
paragraphs 34 and 58 of Guidelines EBA/GL/2017/06:  
‒ it is irregular in implementing the process of assessing individual impa irments (less than 
once a year), whereby the calculation of individual impairments fails to take account of all 
up-to-date information, while the information on collateral values is not correctly used in the 
cashflow projection in cases when single collate ral is used for multiple credit exposures,  
‒ it failed to ensure that factors that impact changes in credit risk and estimates of expected 
credit losses are comprehensively identified at least once a year (expected credit losses do 
not include all impacts o n changes in risk: collateral, arrears),  
‒ when assessing the adequacy of allowances it fails to take account of relevant 
macroeconomic factors (GDP growth, unemployment rate, real estate price index) and 
expectations at the reporting date that may affect t he collectability of remaining cashflows 
over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending exposure.  
 
The savings bank must reclassify customer ID 79123 to Stage 3, reassess the collateral value and 
create individual impairments.  
The savin gs bank must reclassify customer ID 80594 to Stage 2 and recreate collective impairments 
in accordance with the credit rating and collateral value.  
The savings bank must reclassify customer ID 81456 to Stage 2 and recreate collective impairments 
in accordance with the credit rating and collateral value.  
 
For all three of the aforementioned customers, the savings bank must submit evidence to Banka 
Slovenije that the requirements have been met as at 31 March 2023.  
 
To rectify the identified breaches the savings bank must ensure compliance with the seventh indent 
of the fourth paragraph of Article 12 and the first paragraph of Article 16 of the Regulation  of credit 
risk management, and must put in place an effective credit monitoring system, which must monitor 
the appropriateness of the allowances and provisions created, whereby it must put in place 
procedures, mechanisms and criteria for obtaining all rel evant, currently available and up -to-date 
quantitative and qualitative information about the debtor and the exposure that are of relevance to 
credit processes and credit assessment systems. In the calculation of individual impairments the 
savings bank must  take account of up -to-date information, which must be updated by users in the 
event of any changes, whereby the users must understand the software support. The savings bank 
must correctly use information on collateral value in cashflow projections when co llateral is used for 
multiple credit exposures, whereby it will comply with the requirements of paragraphs 34 and 58 of 
Guidelines EBA/GL/2017/06.  
 
5. The savings bank has breached the first paragraph in connection with the second and fifth 
paragraphs of Article 170 of the ZBan -3, by concluding legal transactions with persons in a special

Thus, taking into account points 1 and 8 of the second paragraph in connection with the 
fourth paragraph of Article 62 of the ZBan -2, the undertaking was the owner of a qualifying 
holding in the savings bank equal to 70 .78% of the capital and voting rights of the savings

hereinafter: the ZPPDFT -2)  
 
 Banka Slovenije conducted an inspection of  the bank’s operations in the 
area of AML/CFT between 17 January 2022 and 28 February 2022. A 
comprehensive review of the bank’s operations was conducted with the 
aim of verifying whether the bank upholds the requirements under the 
ZPPDFT -2 (and the previo usly valid ZPPDFT -1) in its operations.  
 
Breaches of the ZPPDFT -2 were identified based on the inspection, for 
which reason Banka Slovenije issued the bank an order on the 
rectification of breaches in accordance with the first paragraph of 
Article 164 of the ZPPDFT -2 in connection with the first paragraph of 
Article 279 of the ZBan -3. The bank lodged an objection to the 
aforementioned order. Banka Slovenije rejected that objection in full.   
 
Nature of identified 
breaches  The breaches relate to the systematic arrangement of the area of 
AML/CFT, and to the deficient implementation of prescribed measures 
in connection with customers with whom the bank has entered into a 
business relationship.  
Operational part of order on rectification of breaches  
1. On the basis of an inspection of SKB banka d.d., of Ajdovščina 4, 1513 Ljubljana (hereinafter: the 
bank) conducted between 17 January 2022 and 28 February 2022 in the area of anti -money 
laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (hereinafter: AML /CFT), Banka Slovenije 
finds that the bank breached the following provisions of the ZPPDFT -2: 
 
a) the third indent of the first paragraph of Article 86 of the ZPPDFT -2 in connection with the 
fourth paragraph of the same article and the first paragraph of Arti cle 84 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or 
the third indent of the first paragraph of Article 79 of the Prevention of Money Laundering and 
Terrorist Financing Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, Nos. 68/2016, 81/2019, 
36/2020 [ZIUOPOK], 49/2020 [ZIUZEOP], 6 1/2020 [ZIUZEOP -A] and 91/2020; hereinafter: 
the ZPPDFT -1) in connection with the fourth paragraph of the same article and the first 
paragraph of Article 77 of the ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the inspection), by:  
- failing to ensure, with its positionin g of the AML/CFT officer in the Security Department, 
that the AML/CFT officer is able to perform tasks as an independent organisational unit 
directly answerable to the management board that is functionally and organisationally 
segregated from other organis ational units;  
 
- failing to provide for stable personnel of the requisite expertise to perform tasks in the 
area of AML/CFT, because of the frequent replacement of employees in the AML/CFT 
team, the hiring of less -experienced personnel and deficient deputis ation, thereby failing 
to ensure adequate personnel conditions of work for the AML/CFT officer;  
 
- appointing a person without the requisite experience of performing the tasks of an 

 
 
 
                   
 
 AML/CFT officer to the position of AML/CFT officer;  
 
b) the first paragraph of Article 20 of the ZPPDFT -2 in connection with the third indent of the 
second paragraph of Article 17 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or the first paragraph of Article 15 of the 
ZPPDFT -1 in connection with the third indent of the second paragraph of Article 12 of the 
ZPPD FT-1 in force at the time of the inspection), by failing to put in place adequate policies 
for the effective mitigation and management of ML/TF risks.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breaches, the bank shall:  
 
a) ensure the proper organisation of the AML/CFT f unction, such that it is organised as an 
independent organisational unit directly answerable to the management board that is 
functionally and organisationally segregated from other organisational units, in the manner 
that other key functions at the bank (e .g. compliance, internal audit) are organised. The bank 
shall also put in place appropriate measures to ensure a stable team with the requisite expertise 
to work in the area of AML/CFT, including the provision of an AML/CFT officer who meets 
all the condit ions prescribed by law;  
 
b) adopt its own umbrella policy for the area of AML/CFT, in which procedures and rules for the 
adequate management of ML/TF risks are defined at the level of the bank. In the 
aforementioned policy the bank shall clearly define the sy stem of internal governance in the 
area of AML/CFT, including a definition of the powers and responsibilities at the level of the 
bank as a whole in connection with the performance of individual tasks in the area of 
AML/CFT, and a definition of reporting l ines and the system of internal controls. In the 
aforementioned policy the bank shall also take account of the requirements defined at the level 
of the parent bank and the group. If the bank treats individual areas more stringently, this shall 
be evident f rom the umbrella policy and also from the operational instructions. With the aim 
of reducing the large number of bylaws in the area of AML/CFT, the bank shall ensure the 
review, optimisation and mutual compliance of the existing bylaws.  
 
2. On the basis of th e review of the sample of customers Banka Slovenije finds the bank to have also 
breached the following provisions of the ZPPDFT -2: 
 
a) point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 21 in connection with the second paragraph of Article 
53 and point 4 of the first paragraph of Article 150 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or point 3 of the first 
paragraph of Article 16 in connection with the first paragraph of Article 48 and point 4 of the 
first paragraph of Article 137 of the ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the inspection), by 
failing to ensure, when obtaining the legally prescribed information about the customer’s 
activities and the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, that the information 
was obtained in a scope and in a manner such that it is understandable to the bank. The 
aforementioned breach was identified in respect of seven (7) customers in retail banking 
(customer designations: 050947, 392218, 380948, 038360, 395291, 056899 and 334608), and 
three (3) customers in corporate banking (customer designation s: 065382, 035943, 067062);  
 
b) the second and seventh paragraphs of Article 18 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or the second and fourth 
paragraphs of Article 13 of the ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the inspection) in connection 
with the Banka Slovenije guidelines on the  assessment of ML/TF risks (section 2.3 of the 
current guidelines adopted on 5 May 2022, or section 4 of the previous version of the 
guidelines adopted on 5 November 2019), by failing to define appropriate customer risk 
assessments that reflect the specifi c attributes of the customer and their transactions in respect 
of five (5) customers (customer designations: 067062, 039491, 391856, 109732 and 025972);  
 
c) the second paragraph of Article 19 in connection with the second and fourth paragraphs of 

 
 
 
                   
 
 Article 64 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or the second paragraph of Article 14 in connection with the 
second and fourth paragraphs of Article 59 of the ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the 
inspection), by failing to conduct enhanced customer due diligence in respect of eight (8) 
customers (customer designations: 392218, 362172, 380948, 605832, 473374, 548849, 
800898 and 391856) that the bank assessed as posing an increased risk of money laundering or 
terrorist financing in accordance with the internal risk assessment;  
 
d) the first a nd sixth paragraphs of Article 54 of the ZPPDFT -2 (the first and sixth paragraphs of 
Article 49 of the ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the inspection), by failing to do the 
following in its ongoing monitoring of business activities:  
- ensure that the inform ation and documentation obtained about the customer are 
updated as appropriate in respect of seven (7) customers (customer designations: 
473374, 362172, 391856, 548849, 800898, 334608 and 605832),  
- examine whether the customer’s transactions accord with the  purpose and intended 
nature of the business relationship and whether the customer’s transactions are in line 
with the usual scale of its transactions in respect of three (3) customers (customer 
designations: 396738, 368168 and 041308); and  
 
e) the first paragraph of Article 55 of the ZPPDFT -2 (or the first paragraph of Article 50 of the 
ZPPDFT -1 in force at the time of the inspection), by failing, in the case of complex and 
unusually large transactions or transactions that have an unusual composition, do not have a 
clear economically or legally justified purpose or do not comply with the customer’s usual 
transactions, to provide for in -depth analysis of flagged deviations in respect of eight (8) 
customers (customer designations 380948 , 605832, 396738, 0740 25, 036902, 473374, 109732 
and 25972), and consequently failing to examine the background and purpose of the 
transactions and to establish the source of funds.  
  
To rectify the aforementioned breaches, the bank shall:  
 
a) when entering into new business relat ionships, ensure that better -quality information is 
obtained about the customer’s business activities and the purpose and intended nature of the 
business relationship, in a scope and a manner that is understandable to the bank in the sense 
of KYC and under standing the customer’s transactions; within the framework of the regular 
updating of the information and documentation obtained about the customer, the bank shall 
assess in respect of existing customers whether the information obtained about the customer’ s 
business activities and the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship is 
understandable to the bank, updating it appropriately if it is not;  
 
b) when defining the customer risk assessment, consistently apply the criteria defined in the 
bank’ s bylaws, and take account of any additional guidance provided by the AML/CFT 
officer;

standard, which is a prerequisite for managing increased AML/CFT risks in connection with 
an individual customer;  
 
d) as part of its ongoing monitoring of the customer’s business activities ensure the consistent 
updating of the information and documentation obtained about the customer, and in so doing 
devote particular attention to examining whether the customer’s transac tions accord with the 
purpose and intended nature of the business relationship and whether the customer’s 
transactions comply with their usual scale; in its ongoing monitoring the bank shall also 

 
 
 
                   
 
 devote particular attention to the comprehensive treatment o f the customer, which means that 
in the case of transactions between related parties it diligently reviews and verifies the 
background of the executed transactions (e.g. transfers of funds between the customer’s 
personal account and the business account of  an undertaking where the customer acts as the 
founder or the statutory representative, assuming that both accounts are held with the bank);  
 
e) in the event of flagged deviations from usual transactions conduct in -depth analysis of the 
transactions, with the  aim of establishing he background and purposes of the executed 
transactions, including the establishment of the source of funds, which inter alia  includes the 
collection of relevant evidence, such as contracts and invoices, and later must also ensure 
critical assessment of the clarifications and evidence obtained.

hereinafter: ZPotK -2) and 
of the Banking  Act 
(Official Gazette of the 
Republic of Slovenia, No. 
25/15 with subsequent 
changes, hereinafter: 
ZBan -2) Between 25 September 2020 and  23 October 20 20, Banka Slovenije 
conducted an inspection of the credit institution  in the area of consumer 
lending and compliance with the provisions of ZPotK -2. 
 
The inspection  has highlighted a breach of the rules of ZPotK -2 and 
ZBan -2 regarding the def inition of a loan  in a foreign currency and 
managing business documentation, as evident from the operational part 
of the order on the rectification of breaches.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  The credit institution  has, with respect to concluding loan agreements , 
failed to adhere to the requirements of ZPotK -2 that enable the 
consumer to evaluate the financial consequences of taking a loan in a 
foreign currency. In addition, it was established that the credit 
institution  does not manage business docume ntation that would enable 
the supervisory authority to confirm the compliance of the credit 
institution 's business operations with the requirements of ZPotK -2. Due 
to the importance and urgency of ensuring regulatory compliance, the 
credit institution  was issued an order on the rectification of breaches, 
requesting it to immediately address the identif ied breaches.  
Operational part of order on rectification of breaches  
1. Banka Slovenije  has, based on an inspection of business  operations  of the credit institution , 
conducted between 25 September 2020 and 23 October  2020 , regarding the compliance of the 
credit institution 's operations in the area of consumer lending with the requirements of ZPotK -2, 
identified that the credit institution  has breached : 
 
a) sixth paragraph of article 7  and point 22 of second paragraph of article 12 of  ZPotK -2 in 
connection with point 7 of article 2 of ZPotK -2, by failing  to correctly specify loans in a 
foreign currency in four (4) case  files from the reviewed sample  (file no. x, file no. x, file 
no. x, file no. x) and as a result did not provide : preliminary information in the form of a 
graph of foreign currency price swings in euro s for the last ten years , a warning in the loan  
agreement that a change in the price of a foreign currency can also change the anticipated 
payment amounts , an explanation of the mechanism of converting the payment in a foreign 
currency into the domestic currency , and the connection between this mechanism and the 
mechanism determined with other provisions on loan repayment so that the consumer can 
evaluate the corresponding financial consequences ; 
 

 
 
 
                   
 
 b) article 168 of  ZBan -2 by failing to organi se its business operation s and manage business 
documentation and administrative records in a way that enables an inspection at any time as 
to whether the credit institution  conducts business in co mpliance with the provisions of the 
second paragraph of article 9 of ZBan -2 in connec tion with article 13 of  ZPotK -2 by failing 
to keep or enable the creation or re -display  of the calculation of preliminary loan repayment 
that otherwise needs to be presented to the consumer on paper or another durable information 
medium , as per the first p aragraph of article 22 of  ZPotK -2, and thus by being unable to 
present to the supervisory authority such calculations for six (6) case files from the reviewed 
sample (file no.  x, file no . x, file no . x, file no . x, file no . x  and file no . x) for inspection of 
the status of the loan after repayment and whether the credit institution  has calculated and 
presented to the consumer in an understandable and cost -free way on paper or another durable 
information medium the reduction of interest and o ther cost s incurred with a full or partial 
loan repayment , and whether the credit institution  has due to a preliminary loan repayment 
charged the consumer a fee in breach of  the provisions of article 22 of ZPotK -2. 
 
In order to rectify these breaches, the credit institution  must : 
 
a) ensure that the preliminary information for all of the loan agreements that classify as a loan 
in a foreign currency as defined in point 7 of article 2 of ZPotK -2 include a graph of the 
referenced interest rate and foreign currency price swings in euro s for the last ten years. Loan 
agreements must include a warning that a change  in the price  of a foreign currency can also 
change the anticipated payment amounts, an explanation of the mechanism of converting the 
payment in a f oreign currency into the domestic currency and the connection between this 
mechanism and the mechanism determined with other provisions on loan repayment , so that 
the consumer can evaluate the corresponding financial consequences ; 
 
b) review its whole consumer loan portfolio, including real estate loan agreements, concluded 
after the enforcement of ZPotK -2, as to whether they fulfil the criteria of a loan in a foreign 
currency, and in affirmative cases ensure that the loan agreement wil l include information on 
the right of the consumer to convert the loan from  a foreign currency to domestic currency , 
and of any currency swing risk reduction mechanisms;  
 
c) organi se its business operations and manage business documentation and administrative  
records, including calculations of preliminary loan repayments, or set up IT support that 
would enable  a supervisory authority to carry out an inspection  at any time with regard to  the 
status of the loan after repayment , and which fee s the consumer has incurred with the 
preliminary loan repayment.  
 
2. The credit institution  must immediately start activities that will  rectify the breaches identified in 
point 1 of this  operational  part of the order on rectification of breaches  (hereinafter : the order ). 
The fi nal deadline for rectifying the breaches is 31.12.2021 . The credit institution  must by

circumstances and 
conduct entailing a breach 
of the ZPotK -21 and the  
ZBan -32  Banka Slovenije conducted an inspection of the bank  in the area of 
consumer lending from the perspective of compliance with the ZPotK -
2. 
The inspection identified breaches of the ZPotK -2 and the ZBan -3 with 
regard to advertising, training in connection with credit agreements for 
real estate, and the management of business records, as proceeds in 
detail from the order on the rectification of  breaches.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  In entering into credit agreements the bank  failed to act as required by 
the ZPotK -2, having failed when advertising in connection with credit 
agreements that contain an interest rate or other information in 
connection with the costs of credit to display the information in the 
form of a representat ive example, and having failed to provide training 
for staff providing services in connection with credit agreements for 
real estate.  It was also found that the bank  fails to provide for business 
records in connection with statements of early repayments o f credit that 
would allow the supervisory authority to verify the bank ’s compliance 
with the ZPotK -2.  
Operational part of order on rectification of breaches  
1. On the basis of an inspection conducted at Banka Intesa Sanpaolo d.d., of Pristaniška ulica  14, 
6502  Koper (hereinafter: the bank ) with regard to the bank ’s compliance with the ZPotK -2 in the 
area of consumer lending, Banka Slovenije finds the bank  to have breached:  
 
a) the third paragraph in connection with the second paragraph of Article 6 of the  ZPotK -2, by 
failing to display information in the form of a representative example when advertising in 
connection with a credit agreement that contains an interest rate or other information in 
connection with the costs of credit;  
 
b) the first paragraph of A rticle 61 of the ZPotK -2, by failing to provide regular training for all 
staff as defined in point 19 of Article 2 of the ZPotK -2, and the fourth paragraph of Article 61 
of the ZPotK -2, by failing to provide regular training for staff transacting with cons umers 
falling into difficulties in connection with arrears in the payment of past -due liabilities from 
credit agreements for real estate;  
 
c) Article 188 of the ZBan -3, by failing to organise its operations and to keep its books of 
account, business documenta tion and other administrative and/or business records current 
such that it is possible to verify at any time whether the bank is operating in accordance with 
the regulations referred to in the second paragraph of Article 9 of the aforementioned act in 
conn ection with Article 13 of the ZPotK -2, as it fails to store and fails to provide for the 
compilation or redisclosure of the statement of early repayment of credit that make evident the 
fee for the compilation of the statement in cases when a housing loan w as repaid by new credit

closing date of 28 May 2021) that it is requir ed to present to the consumer on paper or any 
other permanent data medium in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 22 of the 
ZPotK -2, and is therefore unable to submit statements of early repayments of credit to the 
supervisory authority for all c ases of early repayment for it to be subsequently verified 
whether the bank might have charged the consumer a fee during early repayment of the credit 
in contravention of Article 22 of the ZPotK -2. 
 
To rectify these breaches, the bank  shall:  
 
a) ensure, when advertising in connection with a credit agreement that contains an interest rate or 
other information in connection with the costs of credit, that it displays information in the 
form of a representative example that reflects the assumption that more than h alf of the 
individual class of credit agreements have been entered into with the advertised interest rate or 
a lower interest rate. To ensure that the representative example is current as at the day of 
advertising, the bank  shall put in place a mechanism t o monitor whether the aforementioned 
assumption is being upheld;  
 
b) provide for and regularly update training i) for all employees who perform tasks in connection 
with credit agreements for real estate, or who have contact with consumers within the 
framework  of those tasks; ii) for the persons who directly manage and supervise the work of 
the aforementioned employees; and iii) for employees who transact with consumers who find 
themselves in difficulties in connection with arrears in payments of past -due liabi lities from a 
credit agreement for real estate;  
 
c) ensure the organisation of its operations, keep its books of account, business documentation 
and other administrative and/or business records current, including the proper storage of 
statements of early repa yments of credit, and put in place IT support such that it is possible to

Slovenia, Nos. 68/16,

including amendments; 
hereinafter: the ZPPDFT -1) Banka Slovenije conducted an inspection of operations at the 
aforementioned company between 15 January 2021 and 16 April 2021.  
 
Breaches of the provisions of the ZPPDFT -1 were identified in the 
inspection, for which reason Banka Slovenije issued the company an 
order on the rectification of breaches, in accordance with the first 
paragraph of Article 151 of the ZPPDFT -1 in connection with Article 
42a of the Bank of Slovenia Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of 
Slove nia Nos. 72/06 [official consolidated version], 59/11 and 55/17; 
hereinafter: the ZBS -1) and the first paragraph of Article 279 of the 
Banking Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, Nos. 92/21 
and 123/21 [ZBNIP]; hereinafter: the ZBan -3), again st which the 
company did not lodge an objection by the prescribed deadline.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  Taking into account the penal provisions of the ZPPDFT -1, the 
identified breaches are of the most serious nature.  
Operational part of order for rectification of breaches  
 
1. On the basis of an inspection of the operations of Infra -Investments d. o. o. , Dunajska cesta 136, 
Ljubljana, registration no. 8015368000  (hereinafter: the company), in the area of anti -money 
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (hereinafter: AML/CFT), which was initiated 
on the basis of Banka Slovenije request for inspection referenced  PDO -24.70 -002/20 -1 of 18 
December 2020, Banka Slovenije finds that the company is in breach of:  
 
a) points 2 and 5 of the first paragraph of Article 17 of the ZPPDFT -1 when it defined in its 
AML/CFT policy, with regard to transactions via Bitcoin ATMs, a limit on one -time 
transactions of EUR 1,000 and thus failed to ensure customer due diligence in the prescribed 
manner in the case of related transactions (point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 17 of the 
ZPPDFT -1), and when the amount of a transaction is lower than the aforementioned amount 
and t here are reasons to suspect ML/TF in connection with that transaction, the customer who 
executes that transaction or the funds that are the subject of that transaction (point 5 of the 
first paragraph of Article 17 of the ZPPDFT -1). In the latter cases, the  company cannot 
ensure compliance with the first paragraph of Article 69 of the ZPPDFT -1 with its current 
mode of operations; and  
 
b) the second paragraph in connection with the third paragraph of Article 13 of the ZPPDFT -1 
when it assessed the risk of transa ctions via Bitcoin ATMs as negligible, although such 
transactions are deemed a high -risk service in accordance with the supranational risk 
assessment,1 and by failing to conduct customer due diligence for the users of such services 
(customers) for transact ions of up to EUR 1,000, and because such transactions are 
                                                      
1 The supranational risk assessment report published by the European Commission in 2019 can be found under the reference COM(20 19) 
370 final, while the accompaniment to the report is published under the reference SWD(2019) 650 final.  

 
 
 
                   
 
 completely anonymous on account of the associated distribution channel. Taking into account 
the above -stated facts, the company’s risk assessment is inappropriate, as it does not reflect 
the proper  method for assessing risks inherent in the services that it provides (the company 
assessed risks in connection with anonymous transactions in the exchange of virtual 
currencies into fiat currencies and vice versa as negligible, while it assessed risks in 
connection with OTC transactions via the company’s current account as higher than risks in 
connection with the exchange of virtual currencies into fiat currencies and vice versa via 
Bitcoin ATMs).  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breaches, the company must:  
 
a) comprehensively update previously adopted bylaws and eliminate identified discrepancies in 
accordance with the ZPPDFT -1 and, to that end, define appropriate operating procedures in 
its AML/CFT policy and implement them in practice, as the result of which the company will 
be capable of ensuring: (i) the performance of customer due diligence as set out in Article 16 
of the ZPPDFT -1, including in the case of related transactions (point 2 of the first paragraph 
of Article 17 of the ZPPDFT -1) and the case of a transaction, regardless of the amount, where 
there are reasons to suspect ML/TF in connection with a transaction, customer or funds (point 
5 of the first paragraph of Article 17 of the ZPPDFT -1), and (ii) the necessary reporting of 
identified suspicious tr ansactions in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 69 of the 
ZPPDFT -1); and  
 
b) define and issue a risk assessment that will appropriately reflect inherent risks in connection 
with specific services, taking into account the fact that a service is d eemed high -risk in terms 
of ML/TF when it involves transactions with virtual currencies via Bitcoin ATMS, where 
transactions are completely anonymous. In accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 
13 of the ZPPDFT -1, the company must also take into ac count the report on the findings of 
the national risk assessment and the supranational risk assessment.  
 
The company shall embark without delay on activities to rectify the breaches cited in point 1 of 
this order on the rectification of breaches (hereinaf ter: the order). The final deadline for the 
rectification of the breaches is 31 December 2021. The company shall also submit a written report 
to Banka Slovenije within 10 days of the final deadline on the measures taken to rectify the 
breaches, as set out  in the first paragraph of Article 281 of the ZBan -3. 
 
2. In connection with the activities to rectify the breaches cited in point 1 of this order, the company 
shall draft an action plan clearly defining the activities for the rectification of the breaches, an d 
shall submit it to Banka Slovenije by 30 July 2021.  
 
3. In connection with the activities to rectify the breaches cited in point 1 of this order, the company 
shall designate the persons at the company responsible for rectifying the identified breaches, and 
shall report their names to Banka Slovenije by 30 July 2021.  
 
4. An objection to this order shall not stay its enforcement (third paragraph of Article 375 of the 
ZBan -3 in connection with first paragraph of Article 151 of the ZPPDFT -1 and Article 42a of the 
ZBS-1). 
 
5. The breaches identified in this order also constitute misdemeanours pursuant to the penal 
provisions of the ZPPDFT -1, and Banka Slovenije shall therefore initiate misdemeanours 
proceedings against the company and the responsible persons in these ca ses. 
 
6. In accordance with Article 161 of the ZPPDFT -1, in connection with the imposed supervisory 
measures Banka Slovenije shall publish the following information on its website after the imposed

ordered;  
– the operational part of the decision by which the proceedings are legally finalised; and

Information regarding the potential rectification of a breach or implementation of an ordered 
measure:

timely manner, and reported the names of the persons at the company responsible for recti fying the

group of connected clients as required by Article 7 of the credit risk management regulation,1 and 
- at portfolio level it fails to provide for monitoring of deviations from internal conditions for the

shall also include mechanisms by means of which it can also identify and monitor (and report) 
circumstances that allow for an assessment of whether the customers are interconnected in such a

approval of transactions that are not in line with the policy and the prescribed conditions, and in its

Kylin, and therefore, in accordance with point 8 of the second  paragraph of Article 62 of the 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 2 of 3 
 ZBan -2 in connection with the fourth paragraph of Article 62 of the ZBan -2, the voting rights 
and capital it holds need to be taken into account in the determination of Kylin’s qualifying 
holding. Banka Slovenije established  this on the basis of the following circumstances, which it 
assessed collectively:  
i. when the “Share sale and purchase agreement” concluded between Kylin Prime Group 
AG as the seller and Capstone Global Solutions Limited as the buyer of 29 May 2020 
(hereina fter: sales agreement) had no simultaneity provision for the transfer of 11,000 
LONR shares and payment of Capstone’s liabilities, which on the basis of the 
underlying agreement fell due on 30 June 2020, with Kylin not even demanding any 
collateral when co ncluding the agreement or when transferring the shares to KDD;  
ii. up to the date on which this order was issued Kylin received only three partial payments 
in the total amount of xxxxxxxx , accounting for 33.09% of the total consideration, with 
the remainder of  the consideration of xxxxxxxx  still remaining unpaid, and Kylin's 
claim still remaining unsecured;  
iii. Kylin and Capstone concluded seven annexes to the sales agreement up to the date on 
which this order was issued, each time extending Capstone’s deadline for  the payment 
of consideration (most recently until 31 March 2021), without determining any other 
benefit for Kylin, which in accordance with the underlying agreement is entitled to the 
payment of default interest of 8% per annum in the event of a delay;  
iv. the companies had been linked in business terms even prior to concluding the sales 
agreement, which is evident from multiple financial transactions that were conducted in 
the period 3 January 2019 to 17 January 2020 in the total amount of xxxxxxxx , which 
accounts for more than 80% of the total turnover on Capstone's current account, opened 
at Hranilnica Lon, d. d.;  
v. the company xxxxxxxxxxxxx , comprising a part of the Kylin Group, transferred to 
Capstone on 2 September 2020 xxxxxxxx , which is a large part of th e partial 
consideration that Capstone paid to Kylin on that same day, and on 8 September 2020 
xxxxxxxx , which is the partial consideration that Capstone paid to Kylin on the same 
date;  
vi. xxxxxxxx , the managing director of companies 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx , whose exclusive or partial beneficial owner 
is xxxxxxxx , the president of the management board and beneficial owner of Kylin, 
represented Capstone in business communication with Hranilnica Lon, d. d.  
 
4. Kylin failed to obtain an authorisation for  a qualifying holding for its holding of 52.02% of the 
capital and voting rights pursuant to point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 62 of the ZBan -
2, as it should have done in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 60 of the ZBan -2. 
Accordingly , Capstone also acquired and holds LONR shares contrary to the ZBan -2, and Kylin, 
FIN-NEP and Capstone are therefore ineligible holders pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 
73 of the ZBan -2, and do not hold voting rights from the shares that they hol d in contravention 
of the ZBan -2.  
The final order on the disposal of shares with the designation 0.05.0.7 -12/2019 -42 and reference 
no. PBH -24.50 -004/19 -01 of 29 May 2019 instructed Kylin and FIN -NEP to dispose of all the 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 3 of 3 
 shares that they held in contraven tion of the ZBan -2. Since Capstone, before the acquisition of 
the qualifying holding in the savings bank or within one month of the acquisition of the 
qualifying holding, also failed to submit a request for the granting of an authorisation to acquire 
a qua lifying holding, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 267 of the ZBan -2 it is 
required to dispose of all the shares that it holds in contravention of the ZBan -2.  
It must dispose of the shares in the total amount in excess of a 10% holding of the savings 
bank’s capital and voting rights within four months of the delivery of this order. In accordance 
with Article 268 of the ZBan -2, by the same deadline Capstone must submit to Banka Slovenije 
a report on the disposal of shares, which must include  evidence of the disposal, and information 
on the acquirer or acquirers of the shares.  
 
5. In accordance with Article 277 of the ZBan -2, the following information in connection with this 
supervisory measure shall be published on the website of Banka Slovenije  after these 
proceedings have been completed:  
i. information on the person responsible for the breach:  
 the name and registered office of the legal person, or  
 the name of the natural person;  
ii. information on the breach:  
 a description of the circumstances and co nduct constituting the breach;  
 the nature of the identified breaches;  
iii. the operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed; 
and 
iv. information as to whether judicial protection proceedings have been initiated against the 
decision in accordance with the ZBan -2. 
 
Information as to whether judicial protection proceedings have been initiated against the decision 
in accordance with the ZBan -2 
The order on the disposal of shares referenced PBH -24.50 -001/21 -001, against which an objection was 
lodged by the stipulated deadline, was issued by Banka Slovenije on 17 March 2021. Banka Slovenije

Description of 
circumstances and conduct 
entailing breach of ZBan -2 
or Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013  On the basis of Bank of Slovenia request for inspection PBH -24.60 -
001/19 -001 of 12 February 2019 and Bank of Slovenia authorisation 
PBH -24.60 -001/19 -002 of 13 February 2019, Bank of Slovenia staff 
conducted an inspection of ……………….  in the area of credit risk in 
lending to legal and natural persons.  
On the basis of the inspection the Bank of Slovenia found breaches of 
the ZBan -2 and Regulation (EU) No 575/201 3, for which reason it 
issued an order on the rectification of breaches with an additional 
measure, against which ……………….  lodged an objection. The Bank 
of Slovenia consequently issued a decision on an objection, which 
partly amended the operational part of  the order.  
The circumstances and conduct entailing a breach of ZBan -2 or 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 are cited in the operational part of the 
order below, which was amended in accordance with the decision on an 
objection.  
 
Nature of identified 
breaches  Breaches in the area of credit risk management  
Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
1. …………………………………………….. , registration number: …………….  (hereinafter: 
………………. ), has breached Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in connection  with the first paragraph 
of Article 7 of the Regulation on internal governance arrangements, the management body and 
the internal capital adequacy assessment process for banks and savings banks (Official Gazette 
of the Republic of Slovenia, Nos. 73/15, 49 /16, 68/17, 33/18 and 81/18; hereinafter: the internal 
governance regulation), because its management body has failed to provide for the regular 
review (at least once a year) of the adequacy of its risk take -up and management policies, 
including ensuring t hat they are updated in relation to the impact of factors in the bank’s internal 
and external environment.  
 
…………  must provide for the regular review (at least once a year) of the adequacy of its risk 
take-up and management policies, including ensuring their updating and compliance, in 
accordance with Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the first paragraph o f Article 7 of 
the internal governance regulation.  
 
2. …………  has breached Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the second paragraph of 
Article 88 of the internal governance regulation, because it does not have stable internal 
governance arrangements th at encompass effective risk management processes for identifying, 
measuring or assessing, controlling and monitoring risks, having failed to take account of the 
results of stress tests in the capital planning process and in the definition of measures in 
connection with risk strategies and policies.  
 
…………  must take account of the results of stress tests in the capital planning process and in 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 2 of 7 
 the definition of measures in connection with risk strategies and policies, in accordance with the 
second paragraph of  Article 88 of the internal governance regulation.  
 
3. …………  has breached Article 151 of the ZBan -2 in connection with Article 13 of the 
Regulation on credit risk management at banks and savings banks (hereinafter: the credit risk 
management regulation), becau se it has failed to put in place and implement adequate credit risk 
management policies and procedures, including counterparty risk, having failed during the credit 
approval and monitoring process to assign debtors and exposures to rating grades on the bas is of 
clear credit rating criteria, thereby failing to assign debtors and exposures with similar credit risk 
to the same rating grades. The existing system of rating assignment of legal and natural persons 
does not conform to other systems of classificatio n and credit risk monitoring at ………… . 
 
In its management of credit risk and counterparty risk, …………   has breached Article 178(1) 
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, because it fails to apply the definition of default referred to in 
the aforementioned article i n its systems for assigning debtors and exposures to rating grades. 
…………  has failed to clearly define criteria for the debtor being unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the credit institution, as a result of which it is failing to provide for timely 
recognition of default status, before the occurrence of material arrears of more than 90 days, and 
consequently is failing to adjust the rating grade of the debtor or the exposure to the actual level 
of credit risk. Consequently it has also breached Article  127 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, 
because it erroneously assigns exposures to the class of exposures in default for the purposes of 
calculating capital requirements for credit risk under the standardised approach, and reports 
erroneously in template 18 F 18.00 of Annex V of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 
No 680/2014.  
 
To rectify the identified breaches, within the framework of the credit approval and monitoring 
process …………  must supplement its policies and procedures with clear assignment criter ia 
that are sufficiently precise to allow employees in the credit approval and monitoring process to 
make the same interpretations and consistently assign debtors and exposures with similar credit 
risk to the same rating grades. In the formulation of crite ria for assigning debtors and exposures 
to rating grades, …………  must take full account of the definition of default set out in Article 
178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.  
 
The internal systems of assignment at …………  must provide for the correct reporting of non -
performing exposures in template 18 F 18.00 of Annex V of Commission Implementing 
Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, and must provide for the correct assignment of exposures to the 
class of exposures in default in a ccordance with Article 127 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 
for the purposes of calculating capital requirements for credit risk under the standardised 
approach.  
 
4. a) …………  has breached the first paragraph of Article 148 of the ZBan -2 and Article 167 of 
the ZB an-2 in connection with the second paragraph of Article 30 of the internal governance 
regulation, because it does not have an action plan for managing the risks of a new consumer 
lending product, and its practices in taking up the risks of a new consumer l ending product do 
not comply with the policy of …………  with regard to the management of such risks, …………  
thereby having failed to provide for comprehensive and impartial risk assessment based on 
relevant risk scenarios, having regard for any deficiencies in the risk management process and in 
internal controls for effective risk management, the impact of the introduction of the new 
product on the risk absorption capacity, etc. The product was introduced despite the 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 3 of 7 
 identification of numerous risks that could a rise during its introduction. …………  failed to take 
account of all the deficiencies in the risk management process and in internal controls for 
effective management of the corresponding risks, and failed to ensure that the new product and 
its use would meet the requirements with regard to risk management that …………  would have 
had to meet itself had it offered the product directly.  
 
To rectify the breaches, …………  must produce a comprehensive and impartial risk assessment 
of the new consumer lending product, in which it must take a position with regard to all the 
identified risks and assess whether it is possible to ensure their adequate management. In the 
risk assessment …………  must also take account of factors and principal issues referred to in 
point 2 of Art icle 28 of the internal governance regulation. In particular it must assess whether 
the new product complies with regulations, standards and the bylaws of ………… . …………  
must ensure that the new consumer lending product and its use meet all the requirements wi th 
regard to risk management in the same manner as if …………  had offered the product itself 
directly.  
 
b) …………  has breached the first paragraph of Article 151 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
the third paragraph of Article 19 of the credit risk management re gulation, because it has failed 
to put in place adequate credit risk management procedures, having failed to provide for the 
documentation of the assignment process with regard to the new consumer lending product, 
including the internal control system in t his area.  
 
To rectify the breach, …………  must ensure that the organisation of the assignment process is 
properly documented.  
 
c) …………  has breached the first paragraph of Article 152 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
Article 5 of the credit risk management reg ulation, because it failed to put in place appropriate 
and precisely defined criteria for deciding on credit approval for the new consumer lending 
product, in particular the client’s risk profile and current credit repayment capacity.  
 
…………  has breached th e second and third paragraphs of Article 152 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with the first paragraph of Article 6 of the credit risk management regulation, 
because, in the procedure for concluding an agreement on the sale/assignment of claims, it fails 
to ass ess and analyse the debtor’s ability to settle the liabilities to it, and fails to obtain a 
transcript of credit assessment information from the debtor. Accepting a portfolio without 
reviewing whether the portfolio has the agreed attributes constitutes an elevated risk for 
………… . 
 
To rectify the breaches, for the new consumer lending product …………  must provide for 
appropriately and precisely defined credit approval criteria such that it is possible to make a 
complete assessment of the consumer’s creditworthin ess on their basis. In the related procedure 
for the acceptance of credit into the portfolio via the sale/purchase of claims, which is the 
foundation of the creation of ………… ’s exposure to credit risk, …………  must on each 
occasion assess and analyse quantitat ive and qualitative information and other significant 
factors that facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the debtor’s ability to settle the liabilities 
to it, and must obtain a transcript of the debtor’s credit assessment information. …………  must 
provide for an appropriately professional and objective evaluation of the credit risk assessment, 
and must obtain sufficient information about the client to be able to determine his/her/its risk 
profile or to assess his/her/its creditworthiness and to assign an ap propriate credit assessment

 thereto. It must be particularly prudent with clients with whom it is entering into a contractual 
relationship for the first time. The quality of the claims and the content of the existing credit 
documentation must be known to …………   before the purchase.  
 
d) …………  has breached Article 151 of the ZBan -2 in connection with Article 38 of the credit 
risk management regulation, because it has failed to put in place and implement adequate credit 
risk management procedures for a new consu mer lending product, having failed to put in place 
appropriate information infrastructure for the collection and storage of data deriving from the 
processes of the identification, measurement or assessment, control and monitoring of credit 
risk. IT support  is not yet provided integrally, and the booking and payment of loans is still 
manual, which increases the risk of human errors during entry in the system.  
 
To rectify the breach, for the new consumer lending product …………  must put in place 
appropriate information infrastructure for the collection and storage of data deriving from the 
processes of the identification, measurement or assessment, control and monitoring of credit 
risk. …………  must regularly review the appropriate ness of the information infrastructure. 
…………  must design procedures and processes that ensure data quality from the perspective of 
its accuracy, completeness and appropriateness in all credit risk management processes. The 
accuracy of the data relates to t he level of confidence that the data is correct. It should be high 
enough to ensure that …………  avoids the significant distortion of the final data used in 
decision -making processes. The completeness of the data relates to the inclusion of all 
significant da ta required in individual credit risk management processes, whereby …………  
minimises the occurrence of data shortfalls. The appropriateness of the data means that the data 
may not be biased. For the purpose of reducing the impact of human error, …………  must 
provide for the automation of all material processes. Information systems must be reliable, 
appropriately documented and regularly reviewed.  
 
e) Owing to the breaches cited in point 4 of the operational part of this order, in accordance with 
points 5 and 12 of the second paragraph of Article 250 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the 
first paragraph of Article 250 of the ZBan -2, the Bank of Slovenia hereby orders …………  to: 
 limit its operations in the new consumer lending product to a maximum of EUR 
1,500,000 in total gross on -balance -sheet exposure from operations in the new product, 
in order to mitigate the risks that it takes up in connection with the new consumer 
lending product that entail a material risk to ………… ’s financial position;  
 regularly report to the Bank of Slovenia, i.e. within three business days, on each 
occasion that the total gross on -balance -sheet exposure from operations in the new 
product exceeds an additional EUR 200,000;  
 uphold the limitation and the obligation to report until the rectificat ion of the breaches 
identified in this point of the order.  
 
5. a) …………  has breached the first paragraph of Article 148 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
the second paragraph of Article 30 of the internal governance regulation, because it does not 
have an actio n plan for managing the risks of a new product for lending to real estate projects, 
and it failed to provide for comprehensive and impartial risk assessment based on relevant risk 
scenarios in respect of the new product for lending to real estate projects,  having regard for any 
deficiencies in the risk management process and in internal controls for effective risk 
management, the impact of the introduction of the new product on the risk absorption capacity, 
etc. 
 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 5 of 7 
 To rectify the breaches, …………  must produce a  comprehensive and impartial risk assessment 
of the new product for lending to real estate projects, in which it must take a position with 
regard to all the identified risks and assess whether it is possible to ensure their adequate 
management.  
 
Should ……… … determine that adequate risk management referred to in the first paragraph of 
Article of 23 of the internal governance regulation has not been ensured, it must defer the 
introduction of the new product until adequate risk management processes have been p ut in 
place.  
 
b) …………  has breached Article 151 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the fourth paragraph of 
Article 33 and the seventh paragraph of Appendix 1 of the internal governance regulation, 
because it has failed to adopt and implement adequate credit r isk management policies and 
procedures. …………   has failed to adopt a special credit policy for project financing, which 
demands adjusted procedures and controls.  
 
…………  fails to apply appropriate and precisely defined criteria for making decisions on the 
approval of investments in the area of project financing. …………  has failed to draw up 
operational instructions for  
the approval, monitoring and process of project financing, and …………  has also failed to 
define individual powers and responsibilities. According t o the internal governance regulation, 
work procedures must be set out by means of appropriate instructions, rulebooks and other 
bylaws of …………  that include rules with regard to powers and responsibilities, the allocation 
of tasks, decision -making in the im plementation of procedures, and descriptions of business 
processes. To rectify the breach, for the new product of lending to real estate projects (project 
financing) …………  must draw up and adopt a special project financing policy with adjusted 
procedures an d controls, and must include experts specialising in this form of financing in the 
credit process. They must be included in the initial phase of the project financing approval 
process. Monitoring must be the responsibility of persons who are professionally  qualified in 
this area, particularly in more -demanding real estate projects. …………  must stipulate the

instructions for the approval, monitoring and actual process of project financing. Work 
procedures must be set out by means of appropriate instructions, rulebooks and other bylaws of 
…………  that include rules with regard to powers and responsibilities, the allocation of tasks, 
decision -making in the implementation of procedures, and descriptions of business processes.  
 
c) …………  has breached Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with Articles 27 and 29 of 
the internal governance regulation, because it does not have a policy for the use of outsourcing, 
and fails to include risks inherent in the use of outsourcing in the risk asse ssment process. 
……………….  is defined as an external contractor at …………   who is envisaged in all phases 
of the credit process (approval and monitoring) in respect of the new product for lending to real 
estate projects for the market (project financing) in lar ger, more complex real estate projects.  
 
To rectify the breach, …………  must put in place a policy for the use of outsourcing in 
accordance with Article 29 of the internal governance regulation. …………   must take account 
of the use of outsourcing in the risk assessment in accordance with Article 27 of the internal 
governance regulation. …………  must clearly define the role and responsibility of the external 
…………………… , must draw up a set of potential external  …………………… , and must 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 6 of 7 
 define the method for choosing them for an individual real estate project (required references, 
professional qualifications, etc.).  
 
6. …………  has breached the third paragraph of Article 136 of the ZBan -2, because the 
management board of ……… …  failed  
to ensure that the senior management of …………  would adequately rectify the irregularities 
identified by the internal audit department in accordance with the agreed deadlines. As at 31 
December 2018 …………  had failed to meet 54 recommendations by the  internal audit 
department that had already fallen due. The management board of …………  passed a resolution 
on the take -up of risks for the non -implementation of recommendations whose deadline for 
implementation has passed even after their deadlines for imple mentation had been extended by 
three months. The management board of …………  has thereby also breached Article 45 of the 
ZBan -2 with regard to the duties and responsibilities of the management board, as the 
management board of …………  must act with professional diligence, and in particular must 
ensure that the management board of …………  acts in accordance with Article 136 of the 
ZBan -2. 
 
…………  has also breached the third paragraph of Article 35 of the internal governance 
regulation, because the management board of  
…………  failed to ensure that the failure to observe the recommendations of the internal audit 
department and the delays in the rectification of identified irregularities were systematically 
explained in writing by the recipient of the recommendations by the internal audit department.  
 
In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 136 of the ZBan -2, the management board of 
…………  must provide for appropriate measures to ensure that the senior management of 
…………  adequately rectifies the irregularities identif ied by the internal audit department in 
accordance with the agreed deadlines. In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 35 of 
the internal governance regulation, the management board of …………  must also ensure that 
the failure to observe the recommen dations of the internal audit department and the delays in the 
rectification of identified irregularities are systematically explained in writing by the recipient of 
the recommendations by the internal audit department.  
 
7. The management board of ………… must su bmit a detailed action plan stating the measures

qualifying holding for its holding of 70.78% of the capital and voting 
rights as at 27 May 2019 pursuant to point 8 of the second paragraph of 
Article 62 of the ZBan -2, as it should have done  in accordance with the 
first paragraph of Article 60 of the ZBan -2.  
Accordingly, all of the aforementioned legal and natural persons have 
obtained and hold shares with the ticker symbol LONR in contravention 
of the ZBan -2, and are therefore ineligible ho lders pursuant to the first 
paragraph of Article 73 of the ZBan -2, and do not hold voting rights

(hereinafter: Lendmark d.o.o.), hereinafter referred to collectively as “the entities”, were as at 27 May 
2019 the joint holders of 82,007 ordinary registered shares with the ticker symbol LONR and the ISIN 
code SI0021110323 (hereinafter: LONR shares), equivalent to 70.78% of the capital and voting rights of 
Hranilnica Lon d.d., Kranj, of Žanova ulica 3, Kranj, Slovenia, registration number: 562490800 0 
(hereinafter: the savings bank), as follows:

ii. Sagrada d.o.o. is the holder of 11,500 LONR shares, equivalent to 9.93% of the savings ban k’s 
capital and voting rights;  
iii. Diamant in d.o.o. is the holder of 11,500 LONR shares, equivalent to 9.93% of the savings bank’s

iv. Fin-Nep d.o.o. is the holder of 11,500 LONR shares, equivalent to 9.93% of the savings bank’ s

vii. Zlata doba d.o.o. is the holder of 11,140 LONR shares, equivalent to 9.62% of the savings bank’s 
capital and voting rights;  
viii. Lendmark d.o.o. is the holder of 1,865 LONR shares, equivalent to 1.61% of the savings bank’s 
capital and votin g rights.  
 
2. The Bank of Slovenia finds that the second to eighth of the entities cited in point 1 of the operational 
part of this order are holders of LONR shares under their own names and for the account of the first 
entity cited, Kylin, and therefore, in accordance with point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 62 of the 
ZBan -2 in connection with the fourth paragraph of Article 62 of the ZBan -2, their holdings of voting 
rights and capital need to be taken into account in the determination of Kylin’s qu alifying holding. The 
Bank of Slovenia finds the ownership of the LONR shares by the second to eight entities cited in point 1 
of the operational part of this order to be under their own names but for the account of Kylin on the basis 
of the following circ umstances, which it assessed collectively:  
 
2.1 The manner of purchase of the LONR shares:  
- the shares were obtained from Kylin by the second to eighth entities cited at the same time, or in the 
same time sequence and for the same price:  
 Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet purchased 5,500 LONR shares and 5,000 LONR shares respectively on 
1 July 2018 at a price of EUR 120 per share, and 6,000 LONR shares and 4,322 LONR shares 
respectively on 28 November 2018 at a price of EUR 145 per share,  
 the other entities purchased the shares on 28 November 2018 at a price of EUR 145 per share;  
- the share purchase agreements were identical in their essential parts:  
 the deadline for payment of the consideration under the agreements of 1 July 2018 concluded 
with Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet  was four days for 5% of the consideration, and 90 days for the 
remaining 95% of the consideration; this deadline was extended to 30 June 2019 by two 
annexes,  
 the deadline for payment of the consideration under the agreements of 28 November 2018 was 
two mo nths from the day of the signing of the share purchase agreement for 5% of the 
consideration, and 30 June 2019 for Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet and one year from the day of the 
signing of the share purchase agreement, i.e. 28 November 2019, for the other entities  for the 
remaining 95% of the consideration,  
 if the consideration for the shares is not paid by the deadlines, under all the agreements the 
shares are returned to the vendor within two business days;  
- the share purchase agreements of 1 July and 28 Novembe r 2018 make no provision for simultaneity 
of performance, and during the conclusion of the agreement and the transfer of the shares the vendor 
(Kylin) also required no collateral for the liabilities of the second to eighth entities cited that fall due for 
later payment as follows:  
 despite a delay in the payment of the consideration, as described in the first and second bullet 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 3 of 5 
 points of the previous indent, the vendor (Kylin) did not require collateral for later payment, 
with the exception of Diamant in d.o. o., where a lien in favour of Kylin was registered on 30 
January 2019, which is more than two months after the conclusion of the share purchase 
agreement for the LONR shares;  
 despite a delay in the payment of the consideration and the absence of collateral , title to the 
LONR shares was transferred to Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet as early as 4 July 2018 on the basis of 
the share purchase agreement of 1 July 2018, and on the actual day of the signing of the 
agreement on the basis of the share purchase agreement of 2 8 November 2018.  
 
2.2 The economic circumstances of the sale and purchase of the LONR shares:  
- the price under the share purchase agreements of 1 July 2018 and 28 November 2018 was 
significantly higher than the average share price of EUR 98.09 for LONR sh ares, at which LONR shares 
were sold during the same period on Ljubljana Stock Exchange’s SI ENTER MTF, and the price of EUR 
105 per share realised in the savings bank’s recapitalisation process in May and June 2018:  
 Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet purchased their s hares at a price of EUR 120 per share under the share 
purchase agreement of 1 July 2018 concluded with Kylin,  
 the second to eighth entities cited purchased their shares at a price of EUR 145 per share under 
the share purchase agreements of 28 November 2018  concluded with Kylin,  
 Lendmark d.o.o. purchased its shares at a price of EUR 145 per share under a share purchase 
agreement of 10 December 2018 concluded with Zlata doba d.o.o.;  
- the reasons for purchasing LONR shares cited by the second to eighth entit ies cited do not accord 
with the actual situation:  
 Mr Kenda, Mr Šešet and Lendmark d.o.o. defined their purchase of shares as a good or stable 
investment, while Zlata doba d.o.o. and Diamant in d.o.o. defined the shares as providing a good 
capital and divi dend position, although the savings bank has not paid dividends since 2015, and 
according to public information will remain unable to pay dividends until the loss of 2017, 
which (in absolute terms) far exceeds the savings bank’s profits in recent years, is  covered;  
 Diamant in d.o.o., Fin -Nep d.o.o., Sagrada d.o.o. and Zlata doba d.o.o. disclose the LONR 
shares in their balance sheets as current financial assets, but at the same time claim that their 
reasons for purchasing the shares were the desire to acqui re a long -term investment (Diamant in 
d.o.o.), the expectation of dividends over the long term (Fin -Nep d.o.o.), a plan to upgrade the 
investment in a few years (Sagrada d.o.o.), and the savings bank’s good capital and dividend 
position (Zlata doba d.o.o.) ; 
- Mr Šešet purchased LONR shares at a price of EUR 120 per share on 1 July 2018 and at a price of 
EUR 145 per share on 28 November 2018, while Finses, trgovina in svetovanje d.o.o., of Dolinska cesta 
11B, 6000 Koper, Slovenia, registration number: 634095 4000, which is owned by him and Sofija Šešet, 
sold LONR shares on 9 March 2018 at a price of just EUR 100 per share;  
- Mr Kenda purchased LONR shares at a price of EUR 120 per share on 1 July 2018 and at a price of 
EUR 145 per share on 28 November 2018, wh ile Goldinar, trgovina, čarter, finance d.o.o., of Cesta Zore 
Perello Godina 3, Koper, Slovenia, registration number: 5812518000, which is owned by him and 
Davorina Kenda, sold LONR shares in March 2018 at a price of just EUR 100 per share;  
- a lack of funds for the purchase of the shares:  
 Diamant in d.o.o., Sagrada d.o.o. and Lendmark d.o.o. did not have sufficient funds of their own 
to even pay 5% of the consideration for the LONR shares, and were required to borrow the 
funds, while Zlata doba d.o.o. s ecured the funds to pay 5% of the consideration by downsizing 
its portfolio by selling 360 LONR shares to Lendmark d.o.o.;  
 Diamant in d.o.o., Fin -Nep d.o.o., Sagrada d.o.o., Zlata doba d.o.o. and Lendmark d.o.o. state 
that they will use their own resource s or a loan to settle the remainder of the consideration, 
although given their balance sheets it is highly unlikely that they would be able to borrow from 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 4 of 5 
 banks,  
- the majority of the actual financial burden of the purchase of LONR shares at the time of the purchase 
of the shares was borne, and at the time of the issue of this order is still being borne, by Kylin, given that 
it has not received the majority of the payment for the purchase.  
 
2.3 Other circumstances material to the assessment:  
- the entities are new shareholders in the savings bank, with the exception of Mr Kenda, who was an 
indirect holder of LONR shares until 15 March 2018 via Goldinar, trgovina, č arter, finance d.o.o., of 
which he is a member with a holding of 28.57% and a statutory representative, and Mr Šešet, who was 
an indirect holder of LONR shares until 9 March 2018 via Finses, trgovina in svetovanje d.o.o., of which 
he owns 50% and is a stat utory representative:  
 Kylin entered the ownership of the savings bank in the recapitalisation process of June 2018,  
 Zlata doba d.o.o. entered the ownership of the savings bank on 14 June 2018,  
 Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet entered the ownership of the savings bank  directly in July 2018 via the 
purchase of LONR shares from Kylin,  
 the remaining entities entered the ownership of the savings bank on 28 November 2018 via the 
purchase of LONR shares from Kylin,  
 Zlata doba d.o.o., Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet increased their ho ldings in the savings bank on 28 
November 2018 via the purchase of LONR shares from Kylin;  
- they did not trade in other shares before the purchase of the LONR shares, with the exception of 
Zlata doba d.o.o., Mr Kenda, Mr Šešet and Lendmark d.o.o.;  
- they acquired or, in the case of Kylin, retained holdings in the savings bank of the same value, as 
follows:  
 the first to seventh entities cited each held 9.93% of the savings bank’s capital and voting rights 
as at 28 November 2018, while the eighth entity cite d, Lendmark d.o.o., held 1.30% of the 
savings bank’s capital and voting rights,  
 Zlata doba d.o.o. sold 360 LONR shares to Lendmark d.o.o. on 10 December 2018, thereby 
remaining the holder of 9.62% of the savings bank’s capital and voting rights, while Lend mark 
d.o.o. became the holder of 1.61% of the savings bank’s capital and voting rights;  
- each individually acquired or, in the case of Kylin, retained shares in an amount less than a 10% 
holding in the savings bank’s capital and voting rights, thereby avo iding the requirement to obtain an 
authorisation for a qualifying holding in accordance with the ZBan -2; 
- the deadlines for the payment of 95% of the consideration under the share purchase agreements of 1 
July 2018 concluded between Kylin as the vendor an d Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet as the purchasers were 
extended at the same time, first to 10 December 2018, and then to 30 June 2019, which at the same time 
is the deadline for the payment of 95% of the consideration under the share purchase agreements 
concluded with Kylin by Mr Kenda and Mr Šešet on 28 November 2018;  
- in connection with the sale of the LONR shares, Kylin stated that it sought the purchasers itself or 
through its agent, that it was expressly careful to ensure that no -one was sold shares in excess  of the 
10% allowable threshold, and that it intends to reacquire the shares later, and in connection with the 
savings bank stated that it is a strategic investor;  
- Kylin sold the LONR shares to the second to eighth entities cited after, on 20 November 20 18, 
withdrawing the request for the granting of an authorisation to acquire a qualifying holding for a holding 
of 50% or more.  
 
3. Kylin failed to obtain an authorisation for a qualifying holding for its holding of 70.78% of the 
capital and voting rights pursuant to point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 62 of the ZBan -2, as it 
should have done in accordance with the first paragra ph of Article 60 of the ZBan -2. Accordingly, all of 
the entities referred to in point 1 of the operational part of this order obtained and hold the LONR shares 

 
 
 
                   
 
 
  
 
 
Page 5 of 5 
 in contravention of the ZBan -2, and are therefore ineligible holders pursuant to the first parag raph of 
Article 73 of the ZBan -2, and do not hold voting rights from the shares that they hold in contravention of 
the ZBan -2.  
 
Because Kylin and, in connection with it, the other entities referred to in point 1 of the operational part 
of this order faile d to submit, before the acquisition of the qualifying holding or within one month of the 
acquisition of the qualifying holding, a request for the granting of an authorisation to acquire a 
qualifying holding, in accordance with the first paragraph of Articl e 267 of the ZBan -2 they must 
dispose of all the shares that they hold in contravention of the ZBan -2.  
 
They must dispose of the shares in the total amount in excess of a 10% holding of the savings bank’s 
capital and voting rights within four months of th e delivery of this order. In accordance with Article 268 
of the ZBan -2, by the same deadline the ineligible holders must submit to the Bank of Slovenia a report 
on the disposal of shares, which must include evidence of the disposal, and information on the acquirer 
or acquirers of the shares.  
 
4. In accordance with Article 277 of the ZBan -2, the following information in connection with this 
supervisory measure shall be published on the Bank of Slovenia website after these proceedings have 
been completed:  
- information on the person responsible for the breach  
 the name and registered office of the legal person, or

Kylin Prime Group AG, Sagrada d.o.o., Diamant in d.o.o., Fin -Nep d.o.o., Zlata doba d.o.o., Lendmark 
d.o.o. and Mr Kenda lodged an objection by the relevant deadline. Mr Šešet did not lodge an objection

Description of 
circumstances and 
conduct entailing breach 
of ZBan -2 or Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013  By concluding an agreement to acquire financial assets over the next

1. Primorska hranilnica Vipava d.d., of Glavni trg 15, 5271 Vipava, Slovenia, reference number 
5214246000 (hereinafter: the saving s bank), has breached Article 157 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with the second paragraph of Article 176 of the ZBan -2, by failing to ensure the 
appropriate changes to its management of interest rate risk inherent in non -trading activities to 
reduce the exposure to interest rate risk to an acceptable level, whereby the loss that the

No. 68/17; hereinafter: the credit risk regulation), and Artic les 208 and 229(1) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013,1 by failing to meet the general requirements with regard to credit protection in the 
valuation of real estate for the purposes of assessing credit risk losses and for the purposes of 
calculating capital re quirements. In its portfolio, ...... holds residential and commercial real estate 
whose valuations are based inter alia  on sale and purchase agreements, on gift agreements or on 
the generalised market value, which is determined by means of a mass valuation  approach 
pursuant to the law governing mass valuation of real estate and is disclosed in records managed by 
the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: generalised market 
value).  
 
...... has breached Articles 124, 125 and  126 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, by applying risk 
weights of 35% to residential real estate and 50% to commercial real estate for the purposes of 
calculating capital requirements for credit risk under the standardised approach in individual 
exposures s ecured by mortgage on real estate, even though the conditions referred to in Articles 
125 and 126 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 have not been met, and consequently calculating the 
capital requirements for credit risk incorrectly and reporting them erroneo usly.  
 
To rectify the identified breaches, for the purpose of assessing credit risk losses ...... must exclude 
real estate whose value has not been calculated in accordance with Article 23 of the credit risk 
regulation, and for the purposes of calculating  capital requirements for credit risk it must exclude 
real estate whose value has not been calculated in accordance with Articles 208 and 229(1) of

requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 176 
of 27 June 2013, p 1), as last amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/405 of 21 November  
2017 correcting certain language versions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation

 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.  
 
For the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, ...... must apply  lower risk weights to 
exposures secured by real estate solely in the case of collateral that fully meets the conditions 
referred to in Articles 125 and 126 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. This means that ...... may 
only assign lower risk weights to exposu res secured by real estate whose value has been estimated 
by an independent appraiser at market value or at a value below market value. For exposures 
secured by real estate whose value is based on sale and purchase agreements, on gift agreements 
or on a ge neralised market value, in the calculation of capital requirements ...... must assign a risk 
weight in accordance with Articles 124, 125 and 126 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

of the credit risk regulation, by failing to take account of the relevant haircuts on real estate 
collateral during the estimation of expected cash flows from the liquidation of real estate 
collateral. The assumptions applied to the e stimation of the expected cash flows are not realistic, 
are not based on empirical data, and fail to take account of current and expected market 
conditions.  
 
...... has breached Articles 151 and 153 of the ZBan -2 in connection with paragraph 21 of Section 
4.1.2 of the Guidelines on credit institutions’ credit risk management practices and accounting for 
expected credit losses (EBA/GL/2017/06) of 20 September 2017 (hereinafter: the EBA guidelines)2 
and point k) of paragraph 33 of Section 4.2.2 of the EBA gui delines, by failing to take account of a 
sufficiently wide range of information when using expected credit loss accounting models. This 
information should include information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future 
economic conditions . Information that is included in the assessment of credit risk and measurement 
of expected losses should also be reasonable and supportable.  
 
Sound methodologies in the area of expected credit losses should identify what factors are 
considered when establishing appropriate historical time periods over which to evaluate historical 
loss experience. ...... should maintain sufficient historical loss  data to provide a meaningful analysis 
of its credit loss experience for use as a starting point when estimating the level of allowances on a 
collective or individual basis.  
 
To rectify the identified breaches, in accordance with the EBA guidelines ...... must take account of 
all necessary information, including past events, current conditions and forecasts of future 
economic conditions when measuring expected credit losses. ...... must also undertake the 
calculation of an unbiased estimate of the haircut o n the basis of historical data from repayments 
from real estate collateral and must apply it in the calculation of the requisite impairments and 
provisions, having regard for the Guidelines for calculating default rate and loss rate (in force since 
27 Octo ber 2015).  
 
3. ...... has breached Article 151 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the second and third paragraphs of 
Article 38 of the credit risk regulation, by failing to put in place procedures and processes that 
ensure data quality from the perspective of accuracy in the mon itoring of values of movable 
property collateral. The accuracy of data relates to the degree of confidence in the correctness of 
the data, which must be high enough for ...... to avoid any material distortion of the final data used 
in decision -making proce sses. ...... fails to take account of deterioration or obsolescence in 
                                                      
2 The EBA guidelines are applied on the basis of the Regulation on the application of the Guidelines on credit

 movable property collateral, and fails to ensure realistic valuations in its records. ...... has failed to 
put in place an adequate system for monitoring values of movable property coll ateral during the 
lifetime of the loan. On the basis of a review of credit files and records of movable property 
accepted as collateral, the Bank of Slovenia found that ...... discloses overstated valuations of 
movable property collateral (valuations were taken into account as at ...... as they had been upon 
the approval of the loan), which is a consequence of an ineffective system for regularly monitoring 
movable property collateral.  
 
To rectify the identified breaches, in accordance with the second and th ird paragraphs of Article 
38 of the credit risk regulation ...... must put in place procedures and processes that ensure data 
quality from the perspective of accuracy and must put in place an adequate and reliable system for 
monitoring values of movable pr operty collateral during the lifetime of the loan. The data on the 
actual values of movable property must be accurate, verifiable and up -to-date.

Information on breach    
Description of 
circumstances and 
conduct entailing breach 
of ZBan -2 or Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013  Based on publicly available information, the Bank of Slovenia  
determined that the company in question accepts deposits from the 
public by offering the conclusion of loan agreements as a service on 
its website and by entering into loan agreements with uninformed 
persons, which represents a breach of Article 96 of the ZBan -2. 
 
Owing to this breach, the company was issued with an order on the 
rectification of breaches (resolution passed at the 578th meeting of the 
Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia). Point 1 of the 
aforementioned order on the re ctification of breaches stipulates that the 
company in question has breached the first paragraph of Article 96 of 
the ZBan -2 by accepting deposits and/or other repayable funds from the 
public.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  In accordance with Article 95 of the ZBan -2, only a bank or savings 
bank that has obtained an authorisation to provide banking services in 
accordance with the aforementioned law may accept deposits or other 
repayable funds from the public in the territory of the Republic of 
Slovenia. Article 96 of the ZBan -2 further stipulates that no- one other 
than the persons referred to in Article 95 of the aforementioned law 
may accept deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public in the 
territory of the Republi c of Slovenia.  
The prohibition on the provision of banking services set out in Article 
96 of the aforementioned law protects investors who do not possess the 
necessary expertise and experience to assess the risks associated with 
the borrowing of money (i. e. uninformed persons and the public) 
against the excessive take- up of risks, and in this way protects the 
public interest. In light of the above, the identified breach represents a 
serious breach of the ZBan -2.  
Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
1. 2 PI finančno in računalniško svetovanje, d.o.o., Komenda, Sadarjeva ulica 10, 1218 Komenda ,

Article 96 of the ZBan -2 by accepting deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public.  
 
2. The company shall cease accepting deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public as of 
the day of delivery of this order.  
 
3. Within 15 (fifteen) days of the delivery of this order, the company shall submit to the Bank of 
Slovenia a report in which it describes the measures that it has implemented in connection with 
the cessation of the acceptance of deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public. The 
company may also issue a statement regarding the grounds for the issue of the order by the 
aforementioned deadline.  
 
4. In the aforementioned report the company shall enclose evidence from which it is clear that it has 
implemented measures in connection with the cessation of the acceptanc e of deposits and/or 

 
 
 
Page 2 of 2  
 other repayable funds from the public, and documentation (a list of depositors, with the amounts 
of funds accepted and the maturities of deposits) illustrating the balance of deposits by individual 
depositor as at the day of delivery o f this order.  
 
5. An objection to this order shall not stay its enforcement.  
 
Should the legal person in question fail to comply with the order on the cessation of the acceptance of 
deposits from the public, the Bank of Slovenia shall issue a decision in acco rdance with Article 314 of 
the ZBan -2 establishing that there are grounds to initiate compulsory liquidation proceedings against 
the aforementioned person.  
 
In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 277 of the ZBan- 2, the following information in 
connection with this supervisory measure shall be published on the Bank of Slovenia’s website after 
these proceedings have been completed:

of the legal person or the name of the natural person;  
- information on the breach: a description of the circumstances and conduct entailing the 
breach, and the nature of the identified breaches;  
- the operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed;  and 
- information as to whether judicial protection proceedings have been initiated against the 
decision in accordance with the ZBan -2. 
 
In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 278 of the ZBan- 2, the identity of the person 
responsible for the breach need not be published, if:  
- a supervisory measure is imposed on a natural person, and the publication of information on 
the person responsible for the breach is not proportionate to the severity of the breach; or  
- the publication of information on the p erson responsible for the breach would jeopardise the 
stability of the financial markets or impede a criminal investigation; or  
- publication would result in disproportionate damage to the parties involved. 
 
In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 278 of the ZBan- 2, the Bank of Slovenia calls on the 
company to state the reasons set out in the first paragraph of Article 278 of the ZBan- 2 in its objection, 
if those reasons exist.  
 
Pursuant to point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 375 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the first 
paragraph of Article 380 of the ZBan -2, the Bank of Slovenia is also required to initiate 
misdemeanours proceedings against the company.  
Information as to whether judicial protection proceedings have been initiated against the 
decision in accordance with the ZBan -2  
Judicial protection proceedings were initiated against the decision. Administrative dispute case 
number I U1414/2017 ended with a judgment by the Administrative Court of the Republic of 
Slovenia , which denied the lawsuit by the plaintiff 2 PI finančno in računalniško svetovanje, d.o.o., 
Komenda. The decision by the Administrative Court became res judicata on 27 March 2018.

identifi ed a breach of Article 9(2) of the ZBan -2 in connection with Article 249(3) of the 
ZBan -2, since it did not ensure:  
 the assessment of the existence of a group of connected clients pursuant to Article 4(39)(b) 
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June

(i) a total SREP capital requirement (TSCR) in the amount of ...%, which comprises:  
 
- the minimum capital requirement of ...% set out in Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No

(ii) the combined buffer requirement in acc ordance with Article 228 of the ZBan -2 in connection 
with point 6 of Article 206 of the ZBan -2 and Section 16.3 of the ZBan -2 (Transitional provisions

common equity Tier 1 capital.

Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
1. …….  has breached the first paragraph and point 1 of the second paragraph of Article 136 of the 
ZBan -2, by failing to clearly define and adopt strategic objectives and a strategy for the take -up and 
management of risks that would provide for the effective and prudent governance of …….  
commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business model and 
the activities that …….  pursues. At the same time it has failed to clearly define the powers of 
individual functions and responsibi lities, and has additionally increased strategic risk.  
To rectify the identified breach, ....... must formulate and adopt a business strategy and must 
formulate, adopt and regularly review a strategy for the take -up and management of risks such that 
the internal governance arrangements are commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of 
the ris ks inherent in the business model of ....... and the activities that ........  pursues. In so doing 
....... must at all times ensure capital adequacy in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 129 
of the ZBan -2. 
2. ....... has breached points 2 and 3 of  the first paragraph of Article 9 of the Regulation on internal 
governance arrangements, the management body and the internal capital adequacy assessment 
process for banks and savings banks (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, Nos. 73/15 and 
49/16; hereinafter: the internal governance regulation), by failing to put in place a clear 
organisation structure, thereby failing to control the risk inherent in taking business decisions and 
decisions with regard to risk management at ....... owing to inade quately established reporting flows 
between hierarchical and organisational levels. ....... has also failed to provide for effective 
communications and cooperation on the part of employees.  
To rectify the identified breach, ........  must put in place adeq uate reporting flows, define regular 
reports and provide for procedures for effective communication between different hierarchical and 
organisational levels of decision -making.

Page 2 of 6 
 information that is material to the proper exercise of their powers and responsibilities.  
3. ....... has breached:  
- Points 1 and 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with Articles 9 
and 13, the first paragraph of Article 32 and the fourth paragraph of Article 33 of the internal 
governance regulation, by failing, as a result of the inadequate HR policy of ......., to provide 
for a sufficient number of qualified employees with regard to the operational needs, and the 
scale and complexity of the risk management function for the risks inherent in the business 
model and risk profile of ........ Within the risk management f unction, ....... has also failed to 
provide for adequate internal controls, by failing to ensure the requisite segregation of powers 
and responsibilities in the implementation of work procedures, in particular organisational 
separation, the implementation of the four eyes principle, and mutual vetting.  
- The second paragraph of Article 38 of the internal governance regulation, by allowing persons 
who perform tasks of the risk management function in the areas of credit risk, liquidity risk 
and interest rate r isk to perform other tasks owing to which a conflict of interest could arise 
(e.g. the same employee performs both functions: measurement and management of liquidity 
risk, and assessment of the value of real estate for the purposes of calculating individua l 
impairments).  
- The second paragraph of Article 138 and the second paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with Articles 9 and 13 and the first paragraph of Article 20 of the internal 
governance regulation, by failing, as a result of inadequa te HR policy, to provide for a 
sufficient number of qualified employees with regard to operational needs, and the scale and 
complexity of the risks inherent in the risk management function, and in the back -office 
function, in areas where ....... does not h ave suitable replacement staff.  
To rectify the identified breaches, ....... must modify its organisational structure to ensure the 
requisite organisational separation between the risk measurement function and the risk 
management function in the areas of c redit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.  
....... must draw up analysis and upgrade its HR policy to provide for a sufficient number of 
qualified employees. In so doing it must also provide for adequate deputisation for the responsible 
person perf orming the risk management function and the responsible person performing the back -
office function. In drawing up the analysis and upgrading the HR policy, ....... must take account of 
the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in its business model, and the requirements 
with regard to the effective implementation of risk management processes at ........ 
4. ....... has breached point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the 
fourth and fifth paragraphs of Article 138 of the ZBan -2 (risk management function), the first 
paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 (risk management strategy  and policy), and the first and 
second paragraphs of Article 148 of the ZBan -2 (risk management activities), by having 
deficiencies in its internal governance arrangements in the identification, assessment and reporting 
of risks, the preparation of a risk management strategy, and the formulation of a comprehensive 
overview of the risks to which ....... is or could be exposed in its operations. Direct access to the 
supervisory board of ....... has not been ensured for the head of the risk management function . ....... 
has failed to formulate and adopt risk management strategies and policies for all significant risks. 
The risk reporting system is incomplete. ....... has failed to define risk management activities and

decisions regarding risk management must be facilitated. The risk management function must 

 
 
 
Page 3 of 6 
 ensure the formulation of a comprehensive overview of risk. Direct access to the supervisory board 
must be ensured for the head of the  risk management function. The procedures and activities of the 
risk management function must be formally set out and appropriately documented.  
....... must formulate and adopt strategies and policies for the management of all significant risks. 
The manage ment board must put in place an effective risk reporting system.  
....... must formulate an action plan for managing risks in accordance with the adopted strategies 
and policies that includes, in particular, procedures for identifying, measuring or assessin g, and 
controlling risks, and a method for monitoring the implementation of those procedures.  
....... must set out and appropriately document the procedures and activities for managing each type 
of risk to which it is or could be exposed in connection with  the specific types of services that it 
provides.  
5. ....... has breached:  
- Point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 7 of the internal governance regulation in connection 
with section 2.1.1 of Appendix 1 of the internal governance regulation, by retaining in force a 
Methodology of work in the formulation of credit assessments tha t is still based on the ZBan -
1. The bases for the determination of credit assessments and for assignment to appropriate 
rating grades are cited in the methodology. ....... generally assigns new clients to rating grade 
B, although this is not officially sta ted anywhere. Practically all credit assessment opinions are 
formulated by the head of monitoring and control, who does not have a suitable replacement. 
It is necessary to update and harmonise the methodology with applicable primary and 
secondary banking l egislation.  
-  The first and second paragraphs of Article 131 of the ZBan -2 in connection with the second 
paragraph of Article 79 of the internal governance regulation, by failing to ensure that the 
opinion on a particular investment (before credit approval ) contains information about the 
internal capital requirements.  
To rectify the aforementioned breach, ....... must regularly (at least once a year) review the 
adequacy of the risk management strategies and policies, including ensuring that they are update d 
in relation to the impact of factors in the internal and external environment of ........ In this 
connection ....... must update the existing methodology of work in the formulation of credit 
assessments in accordance with section 2.1.1 of Appendix 1 of t he internal governance regulation. 
The process for the classification of new clients must also be included in the methodology.  
....... must put in place appropriate, effective and comprehensive strategies and processes to 
continuously assess and provide f or the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital that it 
deems necessary as coverage with respect to the attributes and scale of the risks to which it is or 
could be exposed in its operations. ....... must ensure on the basis of regular reviews t hat the 
strategies and processes are comprehensive and commensurate with the nature, scale and 
complexity of the activities that it pursues, and must provide for internal capital to cover such risks. 
The management board must ensure that the results of the  ICAAP, including the internal capital 
requirement and the internal capital assessment, are taken into account in the adoption of the 
business decisions of ......., in the definition and adoption of risk strategies, the risk propensity and 
the risk absorpt ion capacity, and in the long -term capital planning of ........ A credit assessment 
opinion must be supplemented by an indication of the additional capital requirements and internal 
capital requirement, at least for the purposes of legal transactions that require the consent of the 
supervisory board pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 164 of the ZBan -2.  
6. ....... has breached Article 13 of the Regulation on the assessment of credit risk losses of banks and 

 
 
 
Page 4 of 6 
 savings banks (Official Gazette of the Republ ic of Slovenia, No. 50/15; hereinafter: the loss 
assessment regulation) and section 3.4 of Appendix 1 of the internal governance regulation, by 
retaining in force internal guidelines on credit protection that do not comply with applicable 
legislation. Resi dential real estate and commercial real estate are also valued by means of 
generalised market values (hereinafter: the SMARS valuation) without the opinion of an 
independent appraiser. The values are outdated, and old sale and purchase agreements have also  
been taken into account. The subject of the collateral and the collateral value are questionable as a 
result. The SMARS valuation is perhaps justifiable for ....... from the perspective of 
conservativeness, but this method does not comply with applicable legislation, and in many cases 
fails to disclose the true state of real estate collateral. Evidence of insurance policies and 
confirmation of assignment in its favour is missing from the credit files.  
To rectify the aforementioned breach, ....... must upda te its bylaws on monitoring the value of 
credit protection in accordance with Article 13 of the loss assessment regulation. Real estate 
collateral must be valued in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 13 of the loss 
assessment regulation, and i ts value must be monitored in accordance with the fourth and fifth 
paragraphs of Article 13 of the loss assessment regulation. In the case of credit protection by means 
of a mortgage, when the real estate collateral is not in its possession ....... must ha ve at least the 
following documentation in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 13 of the loss 
assessment regulation:  
- a directly enforceable notarial record of credit protection in the form of the entry of a 
mortgage on the pledger’s real estate or of credit protection in the form of the establishment of 
a land debt via an entry in the land register and the issue of a land deed, and, when necessary, 
evidence that the real estate is justifiably in the possession of another;  
- a final court decision allowing the entry of a mortgage or land debt on real estate in the land 
register with a notarial record of the conclusion of an agreement on the pledging of real estate, 
and, when necessary, evidence that the real estate is justifia bly in the possession of another,  
- a current extract from the land register,  
- an insurance policy for the real estate assigned to the bank, and  
- a real estate valuation report determined in accordance with the second paragraph of the 
aforementioned article , which the bank obtains when establishing the real estate collateral.  
....... must provide for regular monitoring of the value and legal certainty of credit protection at 
appropriate time intervals beginning from the approval of the transaction, which de pends on the 
type of credit protection. ....... must monitor the value of credit protection more frequently in the 
event of significant changes in market conditions of relevance to the credit protection, and must 
review it each time that the information at  the disposal of ....... indicates a significant decline in the 
value of the credit protection. ....... must put in place processes to ensure:  
- the monitoring of the value of credit protection, including a definition of the criteria requiring 
the revaluati on of the credit protection with regard to the market situation;  
- the monitoring of the LTV ratio;  
- the independence of the valuation of credit protection, even in cases when the valuation is 
provided by a third party;  
- the determination of the level of co rrelation between the value of the credit protection and the 
debtor’s credit quality;  
- special treatment of credit protection whose value is very volatile and/or that is the subject of a 
very lengthy realisation process;  
- the vetting of the legal certainty and enforceability of the credit protection received.  
 
7. ....... has infringed point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
Article 142 of the ZBan -2 (internal audit function), by having d eficiencies in its internal 

 
 
 
Page 5 of 6 
 governance arrangements in properly ensuring the scope and tasks of internal auditing.  
To rectify the aforementioned breach, ....... must provide for a scope of internal auditing and the 
execution of internal auditing tasks in a ccordance with the standards for the professional practice of 
internal auditing and the corresponding codes (code of internal auditing principles and code of 
ethics of internal auditors).  
8. ....... has infringed point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
point 2 of the second paragraph of Article 136 of the ZBan -2 (functioning of the management 
board, compliance) and with the second paragraph of Article 146 of the ZBan -2 (compliance 
function), by having deficiencies in its internal governance arrangements in ensuring the 
functioning of the compliance function of ........ 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, ....... must ensure the effective functioning of the compliance 
function that identifies the compliance risks to which  ....... is or could be exposed in its operations 
owing to a breach of the applicable regulations.   
....... must review and update all the key bylaws of ........ 
The management board of ....... is responsible for ensuring the compliance of ....... with th e 
applicable regulations and standards.

internal governance arrangements in providing for adequate internal control mechanisms and in 
reviewing the ad equacy of risk management in connection with the assessment and provision of 
internal capital for all the risks to which ....... is or could be exposed in its operations.  
To rectify the aforementioned breach, ....... must put in place appropriate internal methodologies for 
assessing and providing internal capital for all the risks to which ....... is or could be exposed in its 
operations.  
10. ....... has breached:  
- Point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in connection with points 1 and 2 of 
the second paragraph of Article 24 of the internal governance regulation, by failing to put in 
place effective risk management processes for identifying, measu ring or assessing, controlling 
and monitoring the area of liquidity risk, as ....... has failed to put in place a procedure for 
dealing with breaches of risk limits or for determining the causes of breaches, including 
corresponding measures.  
To rectify th e aforementioned breach, .......must put in place a system that provides for the 
identification of breaches of limits in the area of liquidity risk within an appropriate time with 
regard to the nature and type of the risks, and must put in place procedures  for dealing with 
breaches of limits in the area of liquidity risk and for determining the causes of breaches, including

Information regarding breach  
Description of the 
circumstances and conduct 
that represent a breach of 
the ZBan -2 or Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013  Based on publicly available information, the Bank of Slovenia  
determined that the company in question accepts deposits from the 
public by offering the conclusion of loan agreements as a service on its 
website and by entering into loan agreements with uninformed 
persons, which represents a breach of Article 96 of the ZBan -2. 
 
For this reason, the company was issued an order on the rectification of 
breaches (resolution adopted at the 578th session of the Governing 
Board of the Bank of Slovenia). Point 1 of the aforementioned order on 
the rectification of breaches states that the company in question is in 
breach of Article 96 of the ZBan -2 by accepting deposits and/or other 
repayable funds from the public.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  Pursuant to the provisions of Article 95 of the ZBan -2, only a bank or 
savings bank that has obtained authorisation to provi de banking services 
in accordance with the aforementioned law may accept deposits or other 
repayable funds from the public in the territory of the Republic of 
Slovenia. Article 96 of the ZBan -2 further states that no one other than 
the persons referred to in Article 95 of the same law may accept deposits 
and/or other repayable funds from the public in the territory of the 
Republic of Slovenia.  
The prohibition on the provision of banking services set out in Article 96 
of the above -stated law protects investo rs who do not possess the 
necessary expertise and experience to assess the risks associated with the 
borrowing of money (i.e. uninformed persons and the public) against the 
excessive taking up of risks, and in this way protects the public interest. 
In view  of the above, the identified breach represents a serious breach of 
the ZBan -2. 
Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
1. _, registration no.: _ (hereinafter: the company) is in breach of the first paragraph of Article 96 of 
the ZBan -2 by accepting deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public.  
 
2. The company shall cease accepting deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public on the 
day this order is served.  
 
3. Within 15 (fifteen) days following the service of this order, the company shall submit to the Bank 
of Slovenia a report in which it must describe the measures it has implemented in connection with 
the cessation of the acce ptance of deposits and/or other repayable funds from the public. During the 
aforementioned period, the company may also issue a statement regarding the grounds for the issue 
of the order.  
 
4. The company shall enclose with the aforementioned report evidenc e from which it is clear that it 
has implemented measures in connection with the cessation of the acceptance of deposits and/or 
other repayable funds from the public, and documentation (a list of depositors, with the amounts of 
funds accepted and the matur ities of deposits) presenting the balance of deposits by individual 
depositor on the day this order is served.  
 
5. An objection to this order shall not stay its enforcement.

 If the legal person in question does not comply with the order on the cessation of the acceptance of 
deposits from the public, the Bank of Slovenia shall issue a decision in accordance with Article 314 of

responsible for the breach need not be published, if:  
− a supervisory measure is imposed on a natural person, and the publication of data regarding the 
person responsible for the breach is not proportionate to the gravity of the breach; or  
− the publication of information regarding the person responsible for the breach would jeopardise 
the stability of the financial m arkets or impede a criminal investigation; or

In accordance with the third paragraph of Article 278 of the ZBan -2, the Bank of Slovenia calls on the 
company to state the  reasons set out in the first paragraph of Article 278 of the ZBan- 2 in its appeal, if 
those reasons exist.  
 
In accordance with point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 375 of the ZBan- 2 in connection with the 
first paragraph of Article 380 of the ZBan- 2, the Bank of Slovenia shall also be obliged to initiate

Description of 
circumstances and 
conduct entailing breach 
of ZBan -2 or Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013  By virtue of a decision of 4 September 2015 the Bank of Slovenia 
disqualified a supervisory board member from performing the 
function of a member of a super visory board because he no longer 
meets the conditions for performing the function of a member of 
the supervisory board of a bank set out in point 2 of the first 
paragraph of Article 53 of the ZBan -2 in connection with point 1 of 
the second paragraph of Ar ticle 53 of the ZBan -2.  
The supervisory board member lodged a motion to repeat the 
proceedings in connection with the decision issued.  
In the repeat proceedings the Bank of Slovenia again assessed the 
arguments highlighted during the ordinary proceedings,  without 
consideration of the overturned criminal judgement.  
In a repeat supervisory procedure the Bank of Slovenia assessed 
from the information at its disposal that in respect of the 
supervisory board member there were grounds for disqualification 
from performance of the function of a member of a supervisory 
board, because the supervisory board member no longer meets the 
conditions for performing the function of a member of the 
supervisory board of a credit institution, namely with regard to the 
reputati on and traits required to supervise the management of the 
operations of a credit institution, and his conduct raises doubts as 
to his ability to ensure the safe and prudent supervision of the 
management of the operations of a credit institution in accordan ce 
with professional diligence, the highest ethical standards and the 
prevention of conflicts of interest.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  Failure to meet the conditions for performing the function of a member 
of the supervisory board of a credit institution   
Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
The decision referenced x on disqualification from performance of the function of a member of the 
supervisory board of x (hereinafter: x) issued to x (hereinafter: the supervisory board member) 
pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 270 of the ZUP is hereby overturned.  
 
Pursuant to point 1 of the first  paragraph of Article 273 of the ZBan -2, the Bank of Slovenia hereby 
disqualifies the supervisory board member from performing the function of a member of the 
supervisory board of x, because since assuming the function he no longer meets the conditions for  
performing the function of a member of the supervisory board of a bank set out in point 2 of the first 
paragraph of Article 53 of the ZBan -2, in that:  
- he lacks the reputation for supervising the management of the operations of a bank, as 
criminal proceed ings x are being conducted against him, and among the profession and the 
general public his reputation has been sharply diminished as a result of these proceedings 
and also as a result of the criminal judgement by Ljubljana District Court of x, albeit late r 
overturned,  
- he lacks the traits for supervising the management of the operations of a bank, as during 
the procedure of his appointment as a member of the supervisory board of x he concealed 
that he was subject to criminal proceedings, an indication of his lack of professionalism, 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 his failure to uphold ethical standards and his lack of transparency of action,  
- his conduct raises doubts as to his ability to ensure the safe and prudent supervision of the 
management of the operations of a bank in accordance with professional diligence and the 
highest ethical standards, and to prevent conflicts of interest, as proceeding on the basis 
that in the procedure of his appointment as a me mber of the supervisory board of a bank he 
concealed that he was subject to criminal proceedings it follows that he gives precedence to 
his own interests over transparency of action, while from his defence in the criminal 
proceedings in which it is highlig hted that the disclosure of the facts owing to which the 
aforementioned criminal proceedings are in progress was in the public interest it follows 
that he is inclined towards unprofessional handling of information.  
Information as to whether judicial prot ection proceedings have been initiated against the 
decision in accordance with the ZBan -2  
Judicial protection proceedings have been initiated.  
 
Decision on the prohibition of the performance of the function of member of a bank’s supervisory 
board of 23 M ay 2017, was nullified by the Administrative Court of the Republic of Slovenia with the 
judgment of 6 March 2018. The case was returned to the Bank of Slovenia in renewed procedure.  
 
During the new procedure the Bank of Slovenia on 31 July 2018, stopped t he procedure for 
prohibiting the performance of the function of a member of the supervisory board.

for adequate internal cap ital with regard to the nature and scale of the 
risks to which it is or could be exposed in its operations.  
Nature of identified 
breaches  The credit institution has failed to provide for capital in an amount that 
exceeds the requirement set out in Articl e 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 
575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June

Description of the 
circumstances and

breach of the ZBan -2 or 
Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013  The Bank of Slovenia established that the credit institution reduced its 
common equity Tier 1 instruments without obtaining prior permission

instruments of the same or higher quality and without evidence that 
after the activities in question the credit institution’s capital exceeded 
the requirements set out in Article 92(1) of the CRR and the combined 
buffer requirement.  
Immediately after the finding that it had failed to obtain the appropriate 
permission from the B ank of Slovenia, the credit institution embarked 
on the disposal of own shares. It had the own shares at its disposal for a 
very brief period, whereby the right of disposal did not have any impact 
on the credit institution’s capital adequacy. A member of t he 
management board rectified the breach before an order on the 
rectification of breaches was issued, for which reason the member of 
the management board was issued with a decision on the rectification of 
breaches in accordance with the fourth paragraph of  Article 270 of the 
ZBan -2. 
Nature of identified 
breaches  The member of the management board failed to ensure that the credit 
institution operated in accordance with the ZBan -2, in accordance with 
regulations issued on its basis and in accordance with point (a) of 
Article 77 of the CRR.  
Operational part of the decision by which the relevant proceedings are completed  
The Bank of Slovenia finds that the member of the management board:  
 breached point 1 of the second paragraph of Article 45 of the ZBan -2 in connection with point 
(a) of Article 77 of the CRR, by failing as a member of the management board to ensure that 
prior permission for a reduction in its common equity Tier 1 capital a s a result of the 
repurchase of own shares was obtained by the credit institution under his management from 
the Bank of Slovenia as the competent authority in accordance with point (a) of Article 77 of 
the CRR, which has been applied directly in the Republ ic of Slovenia as of 1 January 2014 
pursuant to Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (OJ EU C 
326/50 of 26 October 2012), as a result of which the credit institution reduced its common 
equity Tier 1 instruments without obtaini ng prior permission from the Bank of Slovenia and 
without submitting evidence to the Bank of Slovenia on the replacement of the reduced part 
with capital instruments of the same or higher quality and without evidence that after the 
activities in question t he credit institution’s capital exceeded the requirements set out in

office), credit institution  must also take account of all circumstances to which the Bank of 
Slovenia has drawn attention in point 3  of this order.

substantively sparse. Credit institution  has also breached point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 7 
of the internal governance regulation by larg ely allowing important decisions to be discussed in 
correspondence sessions of the supervisory board, whereby the number of correspondence 
sessions of the supervisory board significantly exceeds the number of ordinary sessions, having 

  
 
 
Page 4 of 13 
 regard for Article 25  of the Rules of procedure of the supervisory board, which stipulates that a 
correspondence session be convened in exceptional circumstances when the management board 
must take a business decision within a maximum of five days.  
 
To rectify the aforemention ed breaches, credit institution  must provide for:  
a) transcripts of the audio recording of sessions of the supervisory board,  
b) substantively detailed minutes of sessions of the governing body and its committees, primarily 
on the basis of the inclusion of infor mation on the persons in attendance, a brief summary of

each set of m inutes by the participants in the session,  
c) a formal definition of the supervisory board with regard to the adequacy of its handling of a 
large number of important matters at sessions of the supervisory board, whereby the 
supervisory board takes account of Article 25 of the Rules of procedure of the supervisory 
board, and the actions to date of supervisory board members at correspondence sessions (in 
general, lower participation than in ordinary sessions),  
d) consistent observation of the Article 25 of the Rule s of procedure of the supervisory board 
and, except in justifiable cases, details of the explicit positions and voting of all supervisory 
board members with regard to each matter that is the subject of discussion on the supervisory

8. Credit institution  has breached the first and second paragraphs of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 7 of the internal governance regulation by 
failing to ensure that the management board and the supervisory board have a unified, consistent, 
long-term strategic overview of the planned recapitalisations of credit institution . The supervisory 
board has breached point 3 of Article 48 of the ZBan -2 by failing to provide its consent to the 
managemen t board for the organisation of the internal control system. Credit institution  has 
breached Article 148 of the ZBan -2 by failing to set out an action plan for managing risks that is 
adopted by the management board of credit institution  with the consent of  the supervisory board, 
after consultation with the risk committee.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breaches, pursuant to point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 7 of 
the internal governance regulation the governing body must:  
a) formally repeal the version of the recapitalisation strategy that is no longer current, and 
define the potential/envisaged resources of the planned recapitalisations of credit 
institution  and the envisaged (target) changes in the ownership structure of credit 
institution  in the perio d to 2020, including the treatment of the issue of the expansion of 
the supervisory board to include representatives of the other owners of credit institution , 
b) provide for a clear process for the supplementation, amendment and repeal of adopted 
strategies,  including a review of the frequency of the amendment of strategies within the 
framework of the documents in question.  
 
On the basis of an appropriate assessment referred to in Article 71 of the internal governance 
regulation, the supervisory board must provide its consent for the internal control system referred 
to in point 3 of Article 48 of the ZBan -2, or propose appropriate measures to ensure the adequacy 
of the aforementioned system.  
 
The management board must adopt an action plan for managing risks referred to in Article 148 of 
the ZBan -2 with the consent of the supervisory board, after consultation with the risk committee.  
 
9. Credit institution  has breached the third paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
point 1 of the first paragr aph of Article 26 of the internal governance regulation by failing to 
provide the supervisory board with comprehensive information on operations and risks, thereby 
preventing the supervisory board from effectively supervising the work of the management boa rd 
and effectively exercising the powers based on which the supervisory board accepts general 

  
 
 
Page 5 of 13 
 responsibility for the effective and diligent governance of credit institution  in conjunction with the 
management board.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, th e supervisory board of credit institution  must formally 
define the following pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 26 of the internal governance 
regulation:  
- the risk reports that it wishes to receive, including their frequency,  
- which reports must contain additional clarifications of risks for the purpose of better 
understanding of the operating position at any particular time (the position with regard to 
limits, recapitalisations, internal assessment of risk -based capital requirements, etc.),  
- the q uantitative and qualitative attributes of loans regarding which it wishes to be regularly 
informed before and/or after their approval, even if the overall exposure to the client does not 
reach 10% of the capital of credit institution  (the supervisory board  determines the appropriate 
percentage),  
- the amount of capital, total assets or number of exposures regarding which it wishes to be 
regularly informed in connection with existing exposures in collective form,  
- the issue of timely information about moratoriu ms provided to specific borrowers, and must 
request appropriate clarifications from the management board in the case of reports that do not 
contain the relevant information about a moratorium provided ( e.g. KZS Laško ). 
 
10. Credit institution  has breached Arti cles 50, 51 and 52 of the ZBan -2 by failing to provide for the 
comprehensive and sufficiently high -quality treatment of all the tasks of the supervisory board 
committees (audit committee, nomination committee, remuneration committee, risk committee) 
set ou t by law.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, the supervisory board must provide for the comprehensive 
and high -quality treatment of all the tasks of the supervisory board committees set out by law in 
2016. The governing body must examine and adopt a fo rmal position (on the basis of an agenda 
item discussed at a session of the governing body) with regard to the possibility of the hiring of 
external advisors referred to in the sixth paragraph of Article 49 of the ZBan -2 for the purpose of 
expert support f or the supervisory board and its committees in the treatment of complex tasks in 
the area of risk.  
 
11. Credit institution  has breached the first paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in connection with 
the second paragraph of Article 17 of the internal governance regulation by failing to define and 
adopt a risk propensity with regard to any significant risks other than cred it risk, as a result of 
which the governing body has not yet adopted its concise risk statement.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, the governing body of credit institution  must adopt its 
concise risk statement, thereby clarifying the approach of credi t institution  to the realisation of the 
risk propensity, and must ensure that the concise risk statement is taken into account in any risk 
take-up by credit institution  at the level of policy and business processes.  
 
12. Credit institution  has breached the fir st paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 and Articles 27, 28 
and 29 of the internal governance regulation by failing to put in place an adequate framework for 
managing the risks inherent in new products and the use of external contractors.  
 
To rectify the  aforementioned breach, credit institution  must:  
- update the rulebook governing the approval of new products, in particular by means of an 
expansion in the concept of a new product, and an approach to the inclusion of new products 
in the risk management pro cess and the internal capital adequacy assessment process 
(hereinafter: the ICAAP), including a definition of the elements that need to be taken into 
account in the approval process for new products on each occasion,  
- formulate a policy for the use of exter nal contractors, including an approach to the inclusion of 
such risks in the risk management process of credit institution . 

  
 
 
Page 6 of 13 
  
13. Credit institution  has breached the first and second paragraphs of Article 140 of the ZBan -2 by 
putting in place a whistleblowing system for reporting breaches whose framework of application is 
too narrow with regard to the provisions of law.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 140 of the ZBan -2 
credit institution  must appropriately expand the Protocol on the whistleblowing system for the 
anonymous reporting of breaches (hereinafter: the protocol) by means of a statement that the  
whistleblowing system also includes the prevention of non -compliance with the regulations 
referred to in the second paragraph of Article 9 of the ZBan -2 and the bylaws of credit institution . 
Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 140 of the ZBan -2, credit institution  must, for the 
purpose of ensuring application of the four eyes principle in connection with whistleblowing, 
define clear procedures for receiving and handling reports, including reporting on findings in 
connection with reports received an d activities carried out, in particular:  
a) in addition to the internal audit department, the protocol must also include the role of the 
compliance function (or the legal department). This must have:  
- the function of recipient of the report of the breach,  
- responsibility for the anonymisation of the report of the breach,  
- responsibility for the appropriate storage of the whistleblower’s personal data,  
- responsibility for monitoring the procedure for handling reported breaches and ensuring 
that the entire proced ure complies with Article 140 of the ZBan -2 and is executed within a 
reasonable timeframe.  
Note: The internal audit department therefore retains the function of handling the 
(anonymised) report of the breach that is obtained on each occasion from the compliance 
department (or legal department), and compiling the corresponding report with findings and 
proposals (as under the existing protocol).  
b) On the basis of the aforementioned conceptual solutions and for the purposes of more 
precisely defining the pr ocedures for receiving and handling reports, the protocol must define 
and clarify:  
- the function, and first name and surname, of the person who is responsible for receiving 
reports of breaches, including persons authorised to perform this function in the ab sence 
of the former,  
- the procedure for anonymisation of the report of the breach by the person responsible for 
receiving the report of the breach,  
- the manner of storage of the whistleblower’s personal data, and a clarification of the 
authorisations of othe r persons with regard to access to this data,  
- the provision of an audit trail for each viewing or modification of the whistleblower’s 
personal data,  
- the data that is expected from the whistleblower, for the purpose of easier investigation of 
the breach:  
- the whistleblower’s first name and surname,  
- the first name and surname of the person responsible for the breach,  
- the first name and surname of others involved in the breach,  
- the desired information about support documentation,  
- the conditions and procedure for subsequent communication (when necessary) 
with the whistleblower by the compliance function,  
- measures to prevent retaliatory acts, discrimination or other forms of inappropriate 
treatment of staff at credit institution  who have reported breaches, and m easures to reverse 
the consequences of retaliatory acts, when inappropriate treatment has occurred.  
 
14. Credit institution  has breached points 2 and 3 of the third paragraph of Article 88 of the ZBan -2 by 
failing to make certain disclosures in the area of cor porate governance, or making deficient 
disclosures.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, credit institution  must provide for the missing disclosures 

  
 
 
Page 7 of 13 
 referred to in point 2 of the third paragraph of Article 88 of the ZBan -2.  
 
Credit institution  must also supplement the deficient disclosures referred to in point 3 of the third 
paragraph of Article 88 of the ZBan -2, in particular in connection with:  
- rules with regard to the ratio between fixed and variable remuneration, including the 
requirement t hat an individual’s variable remuneration may not exceed 100% of the 
individual’s fixed remuneration (point 6 of the first paragraph of Article 170 of the ZBan -
2), 
- rules with regard to the deferral of variable remuneration and rules for the adjustment of 
variable remuneration to risks, including the criteria for the application of internal rules on 
malus or clawback arrangements (points 8 to 10 of the first paragraph of Article 170 of the 
ZBan -2), 
- rules with regard to payments to each individual in connecti on with early termination of 
contract (point 12 of the first paragraph of Article 170 of the ZBan -2). 
 
15. Credit institution  has breached the first paragraph of Article 147 of the ZBan -2 in connection 
with point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 7 of the in ternal governance regulation by failing 
to provide for the governing body’s regular review of the adequacy of the strategies and 
policies for taking up and managing risks, including the methodologies and processes of credit 
institution . 
 
To rectify the afo rementioned breach, on the basis of analysis of the gaps between the ZBan -1, 
the ZBan -2 and the corresponding regulations referred to in the second paragraph of Article 9 
of the ZBan -2 the governing body must conduct a documented review of the adequacy of all 
bylaws in the area of risk take -up and management. In so doing the governing body must in 
particular provide for the formulation or updating of policies, methodologies and processes in 
the following areas:  
a) General:  
- defining the propensity of credit institution  to take up significant risks referred to in 
point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 3 of the internal governance regulation 
(where it has not yet been adopted),  
- appropriately including the “forward view” in methodologies and approaches for 
identifying and assessing significant risks on the basis of stress tests referred to in the 
first paragraph of Article 22 of the internal governance regulation,  
- updating the governance of the ICAAP referred to in Section 4.1.1 of the internal 
governance reg ulation, in particular in the part providing for the consistent  application 
of the results of the ICAAP in taking and supervising business decisions.  
b) Credit risk management : For the purposes of ensuring that risk exposure is appropriately 
taken into account in the calculation of internal risk -based capital requirements in the 
ICAAP, credit institution  must:  
- provide for the adequate assessment and treatment of residual risk r eferred to in 
Article 155 of the ZBan -2 in respect of loans where the initial or subsequent risk 
assessment (credit opinion) identifies poor collateral quality or a difficulty in 
liquidation,  
- take account of the strategy of planned lending and collateral q uality for each 
upcoming period on an annual basis, for example on the basis of a definition of 
planned exposure across exposure classes and grades (government, retail, etc.) and the 
gradual inclusion of the corresponding projections of internal risk -based  capital 
requirements for the upcoming year, divided across months (e.g. in twelfths), in the 
ICAAP for the current month. These projections take account of the client’s risk 
assessment and the results of stress tests on the basis of a relevant projection of a 
deterioration in the credit portfolio for the same period.  
c) Operational risk management:  For the purposes of ensuring that risk exposure is 
appropriately taken into account in the calculation of internal risk -based capital 
requirements in the ICAAP, credit institution  must take account of the specifics of the 

  
 
 
Page 8 of 13 
 rapid development and growth of credit institution , which has exposed it to significant 
operational risk, for example through the use of a moving average over the last three years 
in the calculatio n of average gross income under the basic indicator approach to the 
calculation of the capital requirement for operational risk.  
d) Management of other risks:  For the purposes of ensuring that risk exposure is 
appropriately taken into account in the calculati on of internal risk -based capital 
requirements in the ICAAP, credit institution  must select a methodology that ensures 
compliance with the Bank of Slovenia’s guidelines on the ICAAP and the bylaws of credit 
institution  (e.g. the Development strategy of credit institution  for the 2016 to 2020 period, 
page 20 of which stipulates: “ Credit institution  must disclose risk -based capital 
requirements for other risks of at least 5% to 15% of the capital requirements, if it uses a 
basic indicator approach to the calc ulation of risk -based capital requirements. This method 
of calculation will be applied consistently until it develops an in -house methodology for 
the estimation of risk -based capital requirements for other significant risks.”).  
e) Other areas:  
- bringing the re muneration policy into line with the requirements of the ZBan -2 (in 
particular points 3, 6 and 10 of the first paragraph of Article 170 of the ZBan -2), 
- providing for policy and procedures in connection with persons in a special 
relationship with credit ins titution  referred to in Article 149 of the ZBan -2, including 
updates to the list of such persons,  
- providing for rules of operation for the credit analysis department, and other 
committees and commissions that do not yet have complete rules of procedure (e. g. 
the non -performing investment commission, the claims forbearance commission).  
 
16. Credit institution  has breached the third paragraph of Article 136 of the ZBan -2 by failing to 
ensure that the management board regularly assesses the effectiveness of the ri sk management 
function.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, the management board must provide for a regular (at least 
annual) assessment of the effectiveness of the risk management function, whereby it must in 
particular address the risk management department and the credit analysis department. The 
assessment of the effectiveness of the aforementioned departments must take account of the 
success of the realisation of tasks deriving from the rulebooks and rules of operation of the 
individual departmen ts, and must define the strengths and weaknesses of the two departments, 
including measures to rectify weaknesses. The management board must set out the procedure and 
the content of the regular assessment of the departments within the framework of the risk  
management function by the governing body in bylaws.  
 
17. Credit institution  has breached the second paragraph of Article 138 of the ZBan -2 in connection 
with the second paragraph of Article 41 of the internal governance regulation, as a result of 
deficient r ules with regard to direct access to the supervisory board of credit institution  on the part 
of heads of department within the framework of the risk management function.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, credit institution  must provide for the supplem entation of 
the bylaw governing the organisation and work of the risk management function with a definition 
of the method of notification of the management board and the supervisory board by the head of 
the risk management function at the level of expert d epartments in the cases referred to in the 
sixth and seventh paragraphs of Article 138 of the ZBan -2. 
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, the supervisory board must supplement point 7 of its rules 
of procedure such that the head of the risk management f unction at the level of expert 
departments is provided with regular participation in sessions of the supervisory board in the 
parts relating to the issue of risk, and not “as necessary, according to judgement or if invited to a 
session”.  
 

  
 
 
Page 9 of 13 
 18. Credit institutio n has breached point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with Sections 2.1 and 3.1 of Appendix 1 of the internal governance regulation by 
maintaining the development and custody of the methodology for classifying clients int o rating 
grades separate from the credit analysis department, as a result of which in certain cases there is a 
discrepancy between the credit opinion and the credit assessment of a specific borrower, including 
the provision of regular monitoring of the cre dit quality of the debtor.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, credit institution  must provide for the transfer of the 
development and custody of the Methodology for classifying clients into rating grades 
(hereinafter: the methodology) from the risk management department to the credit analysis 
department, and must ensure that analysts at the credit analysis department have a comprehensive 
understanding of the methodology while having regard for the importance of the independent 
expert assessment of each client. The risk management department must identify weaknesses that 
derive from the  sample of formulated credit opinions and credit assessments, and must provide 
training for the credit analysis department in connection with the proper use of the methodology. 
The procedure for classifying a debtor or exposure into rating grades or pools must be documented 
in a manner that allows third parties to understand the classification, reclassification and 
evaluation of the suitability of classification.  
 
The credit analysis department must monitor the debtor’s operations regularly to determine 
whether the debtor’s creditworthiness is still appropriate, having regard for the type of debtor, and 
the size and complexity of the exposure, proposing reclassifications as necessary. Credit institution  
must put in place an effective process for obtaining an d updating relevant information on the 
attributes of the debtor and the exposure in accordance with Section 3.1 of Appendix 1 of the 
internal governance regulation.  
 
19. Credit institution  has breached point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with the second and third paragraphs of Article 137 of the ZBan -2 and Article 26 of 
the internal governance regulation by:  
- failing to provide the risk management department with relevant and timely information about 
key issues in connection with the operations of credit institution  and its risks,  
- failing to ensure that reports on risks intended for discussion on the supervisor y board are 
understandable, sufficient, useful and timely for supervisory board members.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach:  
a) The credit analysis department must consistently provide for the formulation of opinions on 
the individual investments of credit  institution  on the basis of bylaws, for the purpose of 
ensuring comprehensive oversight of risk by the risk management department.  
b) The investment management section must provide regular reports on non -performing 
investments to the risk management departme nt, the latter defining the content and frequency 
of this information.  
c) The vote exercised by representatives of departments on the central credit committee must 
represent the documented position of the department, and not merely the vote of the 
committee m ember. In the event of a change in a committee member’s position during the 
actual voting on material exposures (i.e. not all exposures), the reasonable grounds for such a 
change must be cited in the minutes.  
d) The credit analysis department must provide fo r the timely notification of the risk 
management department regarding each credit opinion for the purposes of discussion and 
voting on loans at the level of the central credit committee to allow for the formulation of a 
position on the borrower (at least t wo days before the meeting of the committee).  
e) Credit opinions intended for discussion at the level of the supervisory board, and for the 
purpose of ensuring the proper understanding of credit opinions by members of the 
supervisory board, must include under standable information with regard to the links between 
individual internal risk -based capital requirements and the corresponding indicators and 
limits (e.g. capital adequacy, recapitalisation issues).  

  
 
 
Page 10 of 13 
  
20. Credit institution  has breached the second paragraph o f Article 146 of the ZBan -2 in connection 
with point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 7 and Article 42 of the internal governance regulation 
by failing to adopt a compliance policy.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, credit institution  must adopt a compliance policy. The 
compliance policy must take account of analysis of the differences between the ZBan -1 and the 
ZBan -2, and changes in the corresponding regulations referred to in Article 9 of the ZBan -2, must 
formally assess the existing compliance r isk, and must take a position as to whether compliance 
risk is significant to credit institution , including corresponding measures at the level of the ICAAP 
and risk management measures. The analysis of the differences must in particular include:  
- the ZBan -1 (previous) and the ZBan -2, and the CRR in the parts relating to risk management 
processes, the governing body and disclosures,  
- the Regulation on risk management and the implementation of the internal capital adequacy 
assessment process for bank s and credit institutions  / the Regulation on the diligence of 
members of the management and supervisory boards of banks and savings banks (previous) 
and the internal governance regulation,  
- the Regulation on the application of the EBA Guidelines on Interna l Governance (Official 
Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 47/15),  
- the Regulation on the application of the Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of 
members of the management body and key function holders (Official Gazette of the Republic 
of Slovenia, No. 47/15),  
- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 of 4 March 2014 supplementing 
Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to 
regulatory technical standards with respect to qualitative and appropria te quantitative criteria 
to identify categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on an 
institution’s risk profile.  
 
Credit institution  must apply the findings of the analysis of differences between the ZBan -1 and 
the ZBan -2 and  the corresponding regulations in the formulation and realisation of the annual plan 
of the compliance department in 2016 and in subsequent periods.  
 
21. Credit institution  has breached the third paragraph of Article 136, the second paragraph of Article 
146 of  the ZBan -2 and the first paragraph of Article 9 of the internal governance regulation by 
putting in place a deficient framework for the compliance function.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, for the purposes of establishing a department to perform th e 
tasks of the compliance function referred to in the second paragraph of Article 146 of the ZBan -2 
credit institution  must adopt rules of operation that provide for the functioning of the department, 
and must adopt and update other bylaws in the area of r isk management and the action of internal 
control functions on which the establishment of the department in question has an impact. The 
department’s rules of operation and other relevant bylaws must regulate the following inter alia : 
- the appropriate organisation, scale of operation and reporting of the department referred to in 
Article 146 of the ZBan -2, whereby credit institution  must in particular ensure the 
independence of the department and its functional and organisational segrega tion from other 
functions of credit institution  in respect of which conflicts of interest could arise,  
- the manner of the realisation of the tasks of the compliance department referred to in Article 
44 of the internal governance regulation,  
- the notification  of the supervisory board regarding the appointment (dismissal) of the head of 
department, the rules with regard to reporting to the governing body and direct access to the 
chairperson of the supervisory board, and the process of appropriate treatment of a dopted 
measures proposed by the department referred to in Article 43 of the internal governance 
regulation,  
- the methodology for assessing compliance risk, and the procedures for including compliance 
risk in risk management processes and the ICAAP, if such risk is significant.  

  
 
 
Page 11 of 13 
  
Credit institution  must provide for the proper briefing of staff with regard to the adopted bylaws 
governing the area of compliance at credit institution , and the department in question, including 
for the purpose of acting as a contac t address for queries from staff in connection with compliance 
risk. 
 
The governing body must provide for the regular (at least annual) assessment of the effectiveness 
of the department that will perform the tasks of the compliance function.  
 
22. Credit instit ution  has breached point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with point  2 of the third paragraph of Article 35 of the internal governance regulation 
by failing to provide for closer cooperation between the internal audit dep artment (hereinafter: the 
IAD) and the risk management department in the area of the regular notification of the IAD with 
regard to risks for the purposes of formulating an annual work plan tailored to risk.  
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, the manag ement board must provide for the timely 
notification of the IAD with regard to the significant risks of credit institution  by the risk 
management department. The IAD must set out the manner of systematic cooperation with the risk 
management department, and  the manner of regular notification with regard to risks.  
 
23. Credit institution  has breached point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 128 of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with the first paragraph of Article 36 of the internal governance regulation by failing to 
put in place an effective and structured process for the selection of candidates for employment at 
the IAD to allow for the timely and comprehensive internal discussion of the adequacy of the 
knowledge, skills and experience of candidates for the performan ce of their tasks (including 
specific tasks) at the appropriate hierarchical and professional levels of credit institution . 
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, credit institution  must provide for the involvement of the 
head of the IAD in the selection and assessment of candidates for employment, for the purposes of 
appropriately strengthening the IAD in terms of human resources and maximising the provision of 
the requisite knowled ge, skills and experience for the performance of internal audit tasks 
(including specific areas and activities of credit institution ) by the examined candidates for 
employment.  
 
24. Credit institution  has breached point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 128  of the ZBan -2 in 
connection with the first paragraph of Article 35 of the internal governance regulation by failing to 
provide adequate support for the provision of an appropriate independent assessment by the IAD 
with regard to the quality and effectiven ess of the internal governance arrangements, including the 
risk management systems and processes and the internal controls of credit institution . 
 
To rectify the aforementioned breach, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 35 of the internal 
governanc e regulation, which inter alia stipulates that the IAD should support and assist the 
governing body in safeguarding the long -term interests of credit institution  and in protecting its 
reputation, in planning and adopting the annual plan of audits, and havi ng regard for the 
independence of the IAD the governing body must provide for active discussion with the IAD on 
the range of other potentially significant areas for internal auditing, including guidance and 
additional information where necessary. The chair person of the supervisory board must organise 
bilateral meetings on a quarterly basis between the chairperson of the supervisory board or the 
chairperson of the audit committee and the head of the IAD.  
 
25. Credit institution  has breached Article 142 of the Z Ban-2 in connection with point 1 of the second 
paragraph of Article 35 of the internal governance regulation by failing to provide for the effective 
performance of all the tasks of the IAD prescribed by law, including those with an emphasis on 
risks.  
 

  
 
 
Page 12 of 13 
 To rectify the aforementioned breach, for the purposes of monitoring and assessing the 
effectiveness of the internal governance arrangements the IAD must:  
a) conduct an audit of the risk management function in the 2016 to 2017 period, in particular in 
the part r elating to the quality of the realisation of the processes of risk identification, 
assessment and monitoring,  
b) conduct an audit of the compliance department in the 2017 to 2018 period, in particular in the 
part relating to the quality of its assessment of the compliance risk of credit institution . 
 
For the purposes of assessing the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) with 
regard to the internal risk assessment in connection with the deficiencies identified in the area of 
the ICAAP in 2016, the IAD must substantively audit the adequacy of the ICAAP of credit 
institution . 
 
Credit institution  must in general ensure that in its future audits the IAD will devote greater
